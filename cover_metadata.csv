1,The Invasion,Applegate,"Chapter 1
My name is Jake. That's my first name, obviously. I can't tell you my last name. It would be too
dangerous. The Controllers are everywhere. Everywhere. And if they knew my full name, they could
find me and my friends, and then . . . well, let's just say I don't want them to find me. What they do to
people who resist them is too horrible to think about.
I won't even tell you where I live. You'll just have to trust me that it is a real place, a real town.
It may even be your town.
I'm writing this all down so that more people will learn the truth. Maybe then, somehow, the
human race can survive until the Andalites return and rescue us, as they promised they would.
Maybe.
My life used to be pretty normal. Normal, that is, until one Friday night at the mall. I was there
with Marco, my best friend. We were playing video games and hanging out at this cool store that sells
comic books and stuff. The usual.
Marco and I had run out of quarters for the games, right when he was ahead by a lot of points.
Mostly, we're equally good at games. I have Sega at home so I get lots of practice time in, but Marco
has this amazing ability to analyze games and figure out all the little tricks. So sometimes he beats me.
Or maybe I just wasn't concentrating very well. I'd had kind of a bad day at school. I'd tried out
for the basketball team and I didn't make the cut.
It was like no big deal, really. Except that Tom - he's my big brother - he was this total legend on
the junior high basketball team. Now he's the main scorer for the high school team. So everyone
expected me to make the team easy. Only I didn't.
Like I said, no big thing. But it was on my mind, just the same. Lately, Tom and I hadn't been
hanging out as much. Not like we used to. So I figured, you know, if I got his old position on the team .
. .
Well, anyway, we were out of money and getting ready to head home when we ran into Tobias.
Tobias was . . . I mean, I guess he still is kind of a strange guy. He was new at school, and he wasn't
the toughest kid around, so he got picked on a lot.
I actually met Tobias when he had his head in a toilet. There were these two big guys holding
him down and laughing while they flushed, sending Tobias's straggly blond hair swirling around the
bowl. I told the two creeps to step off, and ever since then, Tobias figured I was his friend.
""What's up?"" Tobias asked.
I shrugged. ""Not much. We're heading home.""
""Out of quarters,"" Marco commented. ""Certain people keep forgetting that the SleazeTroll shows
up right after you cross the Nether Fjord. So certain people keep losing the game - and losing our
quarter."" Marco kept jerking his thumb at me, just in case Tobias couldn't figure out who he meant by
""certain people.""
""So, like maybe I'll walk home with you guys,"" Tobias said.
I said sure. Why not?
We were heading for the exit when I spotted Rachel and Cassie. Rachel is kind of pretty, I guess.
I mean, okay, she's very pretty, although, since she is my cousin, I don't really think about her that way.
She has blond hair and blue eyes and that kind of very clean, very wholesome look. She's one of those
people who always know the right clothes to wear and how to look like they just walked out of one of
those fashion magazines girls like. She's also very graceful because she takes gymnastics, even though",Ani 01.0 - The Invasion - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,C:\Users\Admin\MS587 Web and SQL\MS587-Assignment-3\MS587-Assignment-3\Animorphs\story_texts\Ani_01.0___The_Invasion___K._A._Applegate.mp3
2,The Visitor,Applegate,"Chapter 1
My name is Rachel. I won’t tell you my last name. None of us will ever tell you our last names.
Whenever I do use a last name, it’s a fake. Sorry, but that’s the way it has to be. And we won’t tell
you the name of our town, or our school, or even what state we are in. If I told you my last name, the
Yeerks would be able to find my friends and me. And if they ever find us, it will be the end.
They might kill us. Or worse.
Yes, there really is something worse than death.
I’ve seen it. I’ve heard the cries of despair from those doomed to be slaves of the Yeerks.
I’ve watched as the evil gray slugs writhe and squeeze in through the ear and take over what was
a free human being.
There are five of us. Just five: Jake, Cassie, Marco, Tobias, and me. Marco came up with a name
for us, for what we are now. He called us Animorphs.
I guess that’s as good a name as any for what we are. Mostly, I still just feel like a normal kid,
you know? But I guess normal kids don’t turn into elephants or bald eagles. And normal kids don’t
spend their free time fighting to save the world from the nightmares called Yeerks.
That day, the sun was bright. It warmed the earth below us. Warm air rose in an invisible bubble,
a thermal. The thermal pushed up beneath our wings and we circled higher and higher and higher, till
it almost seemed we could touch space.
Somewhere up there in cold space, up in orbit, was the Yeerk mother ship. Perhaps right over
our heads.
The Yeerks were parasites. In their natural state they were just big slugs who lived in a sludgy
pond called a Yeerk pool. But the Yeerks have the power to take over other bodies. They have
enslaved many races throughout the galaxy - the Taxxons, the Hork-Bajir, and others. And now they
had come to Earth, looking for more bodies to control.
Who was there to try and stop them? Well, off in space, there were the Andalites. But the
Andalites were far away, and it would take them a long time to come to rescue the people of Earth.
On Earth, no one knew of the Yeerks. No one but five kids who were having fun being birds and
riding the thermals.
I looked over at my friends. Some were a little way below, some were higher up. Jake was
flapping his wings a little more than the rest of us. He had adopted a falcon morph. Falcons don’t soar
quite as well as hawks or eagles.
Tobias was the smoothest flyer. That was partly because red-tailed hawks are natural acrobats.
Partly it was because Tobias had much more practice flying than the rest of us.
Too much practice.
<Okay, Tobias, you were right. This is the coolest thing in the world,> I said.
<Want to try a dive? It’s amazing,> he said.
I wasn’t exactly sure that I wanted to dive, but what could I say? I don’t usually turn down a
challenge. So I said, <Sure.>
<Follow me.>
Tobias bent his wings back and plummeted toward the ground like a bullet.
I tucked my wings back and went after him.
The ground came rushing up at me.
I was falling! Falling, with nothing at all to stop me from splatting right into the ground!",Ani 02.0 - The Visitor - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,C:\Users\Admin\MS587 Web and SQL\MS587-Assignment-3\MS587-Assignment-3\Animorphs\story_texts\Ani_02.0___The_Visitor___K._A._Applegate.mp3
3,The Encounter,Applegate,"Chapter 1
My name is Tobias. A freak of nature. One of a kind.
I won’t tell you my last name. I can’t tell you my last name. Or the name of the city where I live.
I want to tell you everything, but I can’t give any clues to my true identity. Or the identity of the
others. Everything I will tell you is true. I know it’s going to seem unbelievable, but believe it
anyway.
I am Tobias. I’m a normal kid, I guess. Or used to be. I used to do okay in school. Not great, but
not bad either. Just okay.
I guess I was a dweeb, kind of. Big, but not big enough to keep from getting picked on. I had
blond hair, kind of wild because I could never get it to look right. My eyes were … what color were
my eyes? It’s only been a few weeks, and already I’m forgetting things about being human.
I guess it doesn’t matter, anyway. My eyes now are gold and brown. I have eyes that look fierce
and angry all the time. I’m not always fierce or angry, but I look that way.
One afternoon, I was riding the thermals, the upswelling hot air. I rode them way up into the sky.
The bottoms of low clouds, heavy with moisture, scudded just a few feet above me.
I looked down and focused my laserlike eyes. My fierce eyes, I could still read - I hadn’t
forgotten how to do that. I could see the big red-and-white sign that said: DEALIN’ DAN HAWKE’S USED
CARS.
I pressed my wings back, closer to my body, and began to fall.
Down, down, down! Faster. Faster!
I fell through the warm, early evening air like a rock. Like an artillery shell falling toward its
target.
All was silent except for the sound of the air rushing over the tops of my wings. The ground
came up at me. It came up like it was trying to hit me.
I saw the cage. It was no more than three feet on each side. In the cage was a hawk. A redtail.
Like me.
The man was close by. I recognized him because I had seen him on his TV commercials. He was
Dealin’ Dan Hawke. He owned the car dealership.
He was the one holding the hawk prisoner.
She was a mascot. On the commercials he called her Price-Cut Polly. It made me sick. It made
me furious.
I saw the camera. There were three guys standing around. They would be shooting a live
commercial soon. I didn’t care.
Dealin’ Dan went to the hawk’s cage to feed her. It was locked with a bike-style combination
lock. Four numbers. I could see them as he turned the combination. 8-1-2-5.
I was two hundred yards up, plummeting to earth at seventy miles an hour. But I could see the
numbers as he turned them. And the human part of me, Tobias, could remember.
He opened the cage and tossed in some food. Then he closed it again and spun the lock. Brilliant
lights came on. He was starting the commercial. It would be live on TV all over the area.
What I was planning was insane. That’s what Marco would have said. It was one of his favorite
words. Insane.
I didn’t care.
A hawk was in a tiny cage, being used as a prop for some lowlife car dealer. That wasn’t going
to go on. Not if I could help it.",Ani 03.0 - The Encounter - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,C:\Users\Admin\MS587 Web and SQL\MS587-Assignment-3\MS587-Assignment-3\Animorphs\story_texts\Ani_03.0___The_Encounter___K._A._Applegate.mp3
4,The Message,Applegate,"Chapter 1
My name is Cassie.
I can’t tell you my last name. I wish I could. But I can’t even tell you what town I live in or what
state. We have to disguise our identities, we Animorphs. It’s not about being shy. It’s about staying
alive.
If the Yeerks ever learn who we are, we’ll be done for. If they don’t kill us outright, they’ll make
us Controllers. They’ll force a Yeerk slug into our brains, where it will take control of us, making us
slaves - tools of the Yeerk invasion of Earth.
And I really don’t like the idea of being under the control of an alien. I don’t like the idea of
being dead, either.
On the other hand, there are some things I do like about being an Animorph. Some very cool
things.
Take the other night. It was late. I should have been in bed. Instead I was in the barn, getting
ready to turn into a squirrel.
Technically, the barn is really the Wildlife Rehabilitation Clinic. My dad is a vet. So is my mom,
but she works at The Gardens, this big zoo. The Wildlife Rehabilitation Clinic is just my dad and me.
We take in injured birds and animals and try to save them, then release them back into their natural
habitats.
That’s where I was. In the barn. Surrounded by dozens of cages full of birds, from a mourning
dove who’d run into a car windshield to a golden eagle who’d almost been electrocuted by a power
line.
In another part of the barn we have bigger cages for the badgers and opossums and skunks and
deer and even a pair of wolves who’d been poisoned. At the other end (far from the wolves) we keep
our own horses.
There’s an operating room and a couple of small recovery rooms, too.
Back to that night. Have you ever watched a squirrel in the park? They are constantly alert.
Constantly looking around. It’s like every minute of every day they’re thinking, “Hey! What’s that?”
So I knew that if I morphed into a squirrel, all that nervousness and fear would become a part of
me. It’s something we’ve all had to deal with: controlling the animal instincts, the animal mind that
comes along with the animal body.
Anyway, that’s where I was, in a gloomy barn with just the yellow overhead bulbs to light the
room. Why was I there? Because someone, or something, had been sneaking in and getting at the
birds. We’d lost a patient just the night before. A duck.
And because I couldn’t sleep, anyway. I kept having these dreams. Only they weren’t like normal
dreams, somehow. More like … I don’t know. Just really strange, that’s all.
“Relax, Magilla,” I whispered to the squirrel in my hands. “This won’t hurt at all.” I pulled
some chestnuts from my pocket and handed him one. Another nut fell to the floor.
Some morphs are easy. Some are terrifying. When I was a horse, that was cool. When I had to
become a trout, well, that was a little more weird. The whole time I just kept thinking how someone
could fry me and serve me with tartar sauce.
And I don’t like tartar sauce.
“Squirrel,” I told myself. I always try to get into the feeling of what it might be like to be the
animal before I even start morphing.",Ani 04.0 - The Message - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,C:\Users\Admin\MS587 Web and SQL\MS587-Assignment-3\MS587-Assignment-3\Animorphs\story_texts\Ani_04.0___The_Message___K._A._Applegate.mp3
5,The Predator,Applegate,"Chapter 1
My name is Marco.
I can’t tell you my last name or where I live. Believe me, I wish I could. I would like nothing
more than to be able to tell you my name is Marco Jones or Williams or V
asquez or Brown or
Anderson or McCain.
Marco McCain. Has kind of a nice sound, doesn’t it?
But McCain’s not my last name. I’m not even going to swear to you that Marco is my first name.
See, I’m hoping to live awhile longer. I’m not going to make it any easier for the Yeerks to find me.
I live in a paranoid world. But just because I’m paranoid doesn’t mean I don’t have enemies.
I have real enemies. Enemies that would freeze your blood if you only knew.
So, see, I’d like to tell you my name, and address, and phone number, too, because if I could do
that, it would mean I no longer had any enemies. It would mean my life was normal again. It would
mean I could go back to minding my own business.
I believe in minding my own business.
Which is why what happened on my way home from the 7-Eleven was so dumb.
I was walking down the street with some low-fat milk, a loaf of bread, and a bag of peanut
M&M’s. Since my mom died, I’ve gotten stuck with a lot of the shopping and stuff for my dad and me.
This 7-Eleven isn’t in the greatest neighborhood, so I was walking kind of fast, minding my own
business, trying not to think about the fact that it was after ten at night.
Then I heard it.
“Just don’t hurt me, just don’t hurt me.”
It was a man’s voice. An old man, from the sound of it. It was coming from a dark alley.
I hesitated. I stopped. I pressed myself back against the cold brick wall of the building and
listened.
“Just gimme the money, old man, don’t make me hurt you,” a second voice said. A younger
voice. A tough voice.
“I gave you all of it!” the old man cried.
Then the punk said something I can’t repeat. Basically, he was getting ready to pound the old
man. I heard other voices. Three punks total. It didn’t look good for the old man.
“This is totally not your problem, Marco,” I told myself. “Stay out of it. Don’t be an idiot.”
Three punks. Each of them probably twice as big as I was. I’m not exactly Arnold
Schwarzenegger. I’m not even average height for my age, although I make up for it by being incredibly
cute.
And charming. And witty. And modest.
But I was pretty sure the three big gang members in that alley were not going to be very
impressed by my cuteness.
Fortunately, I have other abilities.
It had been a while since I had done this particular morph, but as I concentrated, I could feel it
coming back. I slipped into the opening of the alley and hid in the shadow of a very smelly Dumpster.
The first thing that happened was the fur. It sprouted quickly from my arms and legs and all down
my body. Thick, rough, ragged, black fur. It grew long on my arms and back and head. It was shorter
everywhere else.
My jaw bulged forward. I could hear the bones in my jaw grind as they stretched and the",Ani 05.0 - The Predator - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,C:\Users\Admin\MS587 Web and SQL\MS587-Assignment-3\MS587-Assignment-3\Animorphs\story_texts\Ani_05.0___The_Predator___K._A._Applegate.mp3
6,The Capture,Applegate,"Chapter 1
I’m Jake.
Just Jake. You don’t need to know my last name, and I can’t tell you, anyway. My story is full of
small lies. I’ve changed people’s names. I’ve changed the names of places. I’ve changed small details
here and there.
But the big stuff is true.
All of it.
The Yeerks are here. On Earth. That is true.
The Yeerks have made Controllers of many humans. They have inserted their gross, sluglike
bodies into people’s brains, and made them into slaves - Controllers. That is true.
Controllers are everywhere. My town. Your town. Everywhere.
They can be anyone. The policeman on the corner. The teacher in your school. Your best friend.
Your mother or father. Your brother.
I know. Because my brother Tom is one of them.
Tom is a Controller. A slave to the Yeerk in his head. If he knew who I really was - what I really
was - he would have me killed. Or turned into a Controller, like him.
That’s what my world is like now. A world where the enemy is everywhere. Even sitting across
from me at the breakfast table on a Saturday morning, which is when this part of the story begins.
“Hey, midget, what’s up?” Tom asked as I sat down. That’s one of the things he calls me.
Actually I’m kind of big for my age. Almost as big as Tom. But it’s a joke we’ve had for years. You
know how it is.
“Not much,” I said. “What’s up with you?”
“Oh, I’m going to a meeting.”
“The Sharing?” I asked, trying to sound casual. The Sharing is this group that tries to pretend like
it’s some kind of combined Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. It’s really a front organization for
Controllers. The leadership council of The Sharing is made up of high-ranking Controllers.
“Yeah. We’re doing some cleanup in the park. You know, do our part for the community and all.
Then we’re having a barbecue afterward.” He gave me a serious look. “You really should join, you
know. We’d get to spend more time together.”
I felt a wave of sickness. I tried not to show it. It wasn’t Tom talking. It was the Yeerk in his
head. The Yeerk who wanted to take my body and use it as a host for one of his fellow slugs.
As I sat there across the table from him, I was trying to decide something. I was trying to decide
whether I would have to ever destroy him. Destroy my brother, who was not my brother. Not
anymore.
“Maybe I will join some day,” I said. Like when hell freezes over, I added silently. I poured
myself some Wheaties and milk. “So you’ll be out for a while?”
“All morning. Mom and Dad are out playing tennis, you’ll have the house to yourself. Throw a
party.”
“Uh-huh,” I said, and spooned up some cereal.
It was hard not to just yell at him. To let him know that I knew all about him. What he was. What
he was doing.
At least, some of what he was doing. I had been spying on my brother. He was rising fast in the
leadership of The Sharing. He was a very loyal Controller. The Yeerk in his head had been promoted.",Ani 06.0 - The Capture - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,C:\Users\Admin\MS587 Web and SQL\MS587-Assignment-3\MS587-Assignment-3\Animorphs\story_texts\Ani_06.0___The_Capture___K._A._Applegate.mp3
7,The Stranger,Applegate,"Chapter 1
My name is Rachel.
And you know the drill. I’m not going to tell you my last name. I’m not going to tell you where I
live. I’ll tell you all I can, because you need to know what’s going on. You need to know what’s
happening.
But I need to stay alive. And if the Yeerks knew who I was, I would be dead.
Or worse.
The Yeerks are here. That’s what you need to know.
People look up at the stars at night and wonder what it would be like if creatures from another
planet ever landed on Earth.
Well, you can stop wondering. It’s happened. The Yeerks are parasites. They live in the brains of
other species - humans, for example. They turn human beings into mindless slaves - human-
Controllers.
So when I say that the aliens are here, don’t go looking around for some cute little thing like E.T.
You won’t see the Yeerks. They are parasitic worms, evil gray slugs that live in the heads of humans.
They can be in anyone. Your best friend. Your favorite teacher. The mayor of your town. Your
brother. Sister. Mother. Father.
Anyone might be a Controller. Y
ou might be a Controller.
So I won’t tell you my last name. Or where I live. But I will tell you the truth. The truth that only
the Animorphs know.
Animorph. Animal morpher. A human capable of becoming any animal. It’s our one weapon
against the Yeerks. Our only power. Without it, we’re just five regular kids.
But with that power comes certain extra responsibilities … as I was trying to explain to my best
friend, Cassie.
It was a Sunday night. It was late. The circus had finished its last show. Their trailers and tents
were clustered around the back side of the big City Arena. The Arena is a place where they hold rock
concerts and ice shows and play basketball games. And where they have circuses.
“Look, we both saw what we saw,” I told Cassie. “Are you telling me it doesn’t make you mad?
That jerk using a cattle prod on an elephant doesn’t make you mad?”
“Of course it does, Rachel,” Cassie said. “I don’t even like circuses.”
“I don’t, either. But my dad had tickets, and it was our big once-every-other-week, father-and-
daughters thing. I had to come.”
My dad had taken my sisters and me to see the circus earlier in the evening. See, my mom and
dad are divorced, so my dad does these little outings where we all get together every second
weekend. Sometimes it’s just me and my dad. Like when we go hiking together, or go to ball games or
gymnastics events. Those are all things my dad and I like, but Jordan and Sara, my sisters, don’t.
My little sisters loved the circus, but it’s not my kind of thing. I guess I’m too old. That’s why I
dragged Cassie along. So I’d have someone to talk to when my sisters were getting all excited over
the clowns and stuff.
Still, it was an opportunity to spend time with my dad, which I enjoy. I don’t get to see him as
much as I wish I could. Everyone always says how much I’m like him. How he’s kind of reckless, and
so am I. He always seems so sure of himself, and I guess people think I’m that way, too. We’re even
both into gymnastics. My dad almost made the U.S. Olympic team when he was younger.",Ani 07.0 - The Stranger - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,C:\Users\Admin\MS587 Web and SQL\MS587-Assignment-3\MS587-Assignment-3\Animorphs\story_texts\Ani_07.0___The_Stranger___K._A._Applegate.mp3

8,The Alien,Applegate,"Prologue
Before Earth …
<Prepare for return to normal space,> Captain Nerefir said in thought-speak.
I was on the bridge of our Dome ship. It was an amazing moment. I had never been on the bridge
before. I’d always been stuck in my quarters, or up in the dome. It was an honor to be on the battle
bridge with the full warriors, the princes, and the captain himself.
It was because I was Elfangor’s little brother. An aristh like me, a warrior-cadet, wouldn’t have
been on the bridge otherwise.
Especially not an aristh who had once run into Captain Nerefir so hard he’d fallen over and
ended up bruising one of his eye stalks. It was an accident, but still, it’s just not a good idea for lowly
cadets to go plowing into great heroes.
But everyone loved Elfangor, so they had to tolerate me. That’s the story of my life. If I live two
hundred years, I’ll probably still be known as Elfangor’s little brother.
We came out of Z-space or Zero-space, a realm of white emptiness, back into normal space.
Through the monitors I saw nothing but blackness dotted with stars. And there, just ahead of us, no
more than a half-million miles away, was a small, mostly blue planet.
<Is that Earth?> I asked Elfangor. <I didn’t realize there was so much water. Can you get Old
Hoof and Tail to let me go down to the planet with you?>
<Aximili, shut up!> Elfangor said quickly. He looked slightly sick and cast a dubious glance at
Captain Nerefir.
I guess I had been thought-speaking a little loudly. Elfangor was worried that War-Prince Nerefir
might have overheard. But I was sure I hadn’t been that loud. I mean, I really didn’t think that -
<Old Hoof and Tail, eh?> Captain Nerefir said. <Is that what they call me?>
Elfangor shot me a poisonous look. <I’m sure this aristh didn’t mean any disrespect.>
I think my brother would have liked to throw me out of the nearest airlock right at that moment.
Slowly Nerefir turned his two main eyes toward me. He was a frightening old Andalite. A great
warrior. A great hero. Elfangor’s idol. <Ah, it’s the ruffian. The wild brat who knocked me over.> He
nodded. <Old Hoof and Tail, is it? Well. I kind of like the name.> He slowly winked one eye at
Elfangor. <I suppose we’ll have to let the ruffian live.>
Suddenly …
<Yeerks! We have a Yeerk mother ship in orbit over the planet!> the warrior at the sensor station
cried.
<They’re launching fighters! I count twelve Yeerk Bug fighters,> another warrior cried.
<They’re on an intercept course. They’ll be in firing range in twelve Earth minutes.>
Captain Nerefir turned his face and his main eyes toward my brother, while his stalk eyes kept
watch on the monitors. The humor was gone from his face. <Prince Elfangor? It is time. Launch all
fighters.>
But Elfangor hadn’t waited for orders. He was already halfway out the door. My tail banged into
the doorway as I plowed after him.
<Get to the dome, Aximili,> Elfangor said.
<But I want to fight!> I said. <I can fly a fighter as well as ->
<Do not argue with me, Aximili. Arisths do not go into battle. You are not a full warrior yet. Go",Ani 08.0 - The Alien - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,C:\Users\Admin\MS587 Web and SQL\MS587-Assignment-3\MS587-Assignment-3\Animorphs\story_texts\Ani_08.0___The_Alien___K._A._Applegate.mp3
9,The Secret,Applegate,"Chapter 1
My name is Cassie.
I can’t tell you my last name. I wish I could. It’s kind of a nice last name.
And I can’t tell you where I live or the true names of my friends. Why? Because the enemy never
stops looking for us.
The enemy. The Yeerks. They’re everywhere.
The Yeerks: a parasitic species from a far-distant planet. All they are is little gray slugs, really.
I’ve seen them in their natural state. They look like big snails without the shell. You could squash one
under your foot and it would be helpless to stop you.
But the Yeerks don’t live out their lives as slugs. Like I said, they are parasites. See, they enter
the head of another species, flatten themselves out, and wrap themselves around the brain. And then
they take control.
That’s what we call a Controller. A human who isn’t exactly human anymore. Or a member of
any species that is controlled by the Yeerk in its head.
Maybe you think what I’ve just told you sounds crazy. I guess if I were you, I’d think it was
pretty insane. But sometimes even the craziest things happen to be true.
The Yeerks are here. Everywhere. If you think you don’t know someone who is a Controller,
you’re probably wrong.
The school bus driver, the police officer in the patrol car, the minister in the pulpit, the newsman
on TV
, the rock star in the music video, the person who smiles at you when you ride by on your bike -
any one of them might be a Controller. Your teacher, your friend, your sister, your mother and father.
Any of them. All of them. And you’ll never know. Until it’s too late.
Until it is too late for planet Earth.
We fight them. But we’re just a handful of kids - Jake, Rachel, Marco, Tobias, Ax, and me. We
have some special powers, but we know we can’t win this alone. We fight in the hope that someday -
someday soon - the Andalites will return and help us.
It was an Andalite prince named Elfangor who gave us our powers. He was dying. He was
desperate. He wanted to do something to help doomed humanity.
He gave us the power to morph. To absorb the DNA of any animal we could touch. To become
that animal.
So we fight the Yeerks and all their Controllers. The human-Controllers who may once have
been our friends and relations. The evil, cannibalistic Taxxon-Controllers, those huge centipedes with
their open, gnashing mouths and foul smell. And the deadly, dangerous, but formerly good creatures
called Hork-Bajir - the enslaved foot soldiers of the Yeerk empire.
And we fight Visser Three. Leader of the Yeerk invasion of Earth. The only Andalite-Controller
in existence. The only Yeerk who, like us, has the power to morph.
The murderer of Elfangor. A killer. A destroyer. The creature who would make slaves of all
humans and destroy our planet.
Unless someone stops him. Unless we stop him.
Five ordinary kids and a young Andalite we call Ax, against all the might of the Yeerk empire.
We call ourselves Animorphs.
We’re only supposed to use our power for fighting the Yeerks. But there are times when it comes
in handy for other things.",Ani 09.0 - The Secret - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,C:\Users\Admin\MS587 Web and SQL\MS587-Assignment-3\MS587-Assignment-3\Animorphs\story_texts\Ani_09.0___The_Secret___K._A._Applegate.mp3

My name is Marco.
People call me Marco the Magnificent. Marvelous Marco. The Amazing Marco.
And of course, all the girls just call me … gorgeous. Okay, maybe I’ve never actually heard
anyone call me gorgeous, but I am confident that someone, somewhere, must have called me gorgeous
at some point.
Or not.
But definitely cute. I’ve heard “cute” with my own ears.
And I’ll soon be hearing it a lot more because I’ve made a major change. I’ve cut my hair. Or at
least my stylist, Charise, cut it for me. That’s right, Charise. And according to Charise, my cuteness
quotient has risen from a nine to a definite ten.
Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes. I was telling you that my name is Marco. I can’t tell you my last
name. I forgot it.
No, not really, I’m kidding. I know my last name. I’m just not going to tell you. And I’m not going
to tell you the complete names of my friends or where I live.
What I will tell you is the truth. All except for that part about “magnificent” and “marvelous.”
Everything else I tell you will be true. I know it will seem incredible. But it will be the absolute truth.
Let’s start with the reason why I won’t tell you my last name: I have enemies. We all sorta do.
But these guys are very powerful, very dangerous enemies. Not like the guy in your class who keeps
calling you “dork-wad.” And if they knew who I was, I’d be dead so fast I wouldn’t even know I was
dead. The Yeerks don’t play games. The Yeerks don’t worry about pity or kindness. They don’t care
that I’m just a kid. The Yeerks plan to enslave or destroy the entire human race. They won’t hesitate to
roll right over little old me.
The Yeerks aren’t just my enemies, though. They are the enemies of every human being. The
enemies of Earth itself. And they are everywhere.
They’re a parasitic species. Think tapeworms. That’s what they are, when you get right down to
it: intelligent tapeworms.
They are slugs, just a few inches long. They enter the human body through the ear canal. Once
inside, they flatten themselves out and wrap themselves around your brain. They squeeze into all the
folds and wrinkles of your brain and tie into your thoughts.
They take over. They make you into what we call a Controller. A human machine. A body whose
own, true mind is shattered and helpless.
That’s the special horror of the Yeerks. They don’t just take over your mind and eliminate you.
You continue to be aware. You continue to be conscious. You sit there in your own head watching the
Yeerk open your memory, watching the Yeerk fool your friends and family, watching the Yeerk turn the
people you love into the same kind of slave you’ve become.
You try to move your hand, but you can’t. You try to make your mouth speak, but you can’t. You
don’t even control what your eyes look at. That’s what it’s like.
My mother is one of them. A Controller.
For a long time, we thought she had died. I believed she had drowned. But I learned later that
she was still alive.
A very powerful Yeerk had taken her body. I don’t even know how long she was a Controller
before she disappeared. I don’t know how many times her good-night kiss was the action of a Yeerk",Ani 10.0 - The Android - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,C:\Users\Admin\MS587 Web and SQL\MS587-Assignment-3\MS587-Assignment-3\Animorphs\story_texts\Ani_10.0___The_Android___K._A._Applegate.mp3

.M.
My name is Jake.
I can’t tell you my last name, or where I’m from. That would just help the Yeerks. They’d love to
find me and my friends. They’d love to know who we are, even what we are.
Knowing my last name isn’t important for you. What you need to know is that everything I’ll tell
you here is true. It’s real. It’s actually happening. Right now.
The Yeerks are among us.
The Yeerks are us.
They’re a parasitic species. They live inside the bodies of other beings. They take over your
mind and body.
Controllers. That’s what you call a creature that is ruled by a Yeerk. A Controller. Something
that looks human, acts human, sounds human, but whose mind is Yeerk.
They are everywhere. They can be anyone. Think of the one person in the whole world that you
trust the most. Think of that one special person. And now realize, believe, accept the fact that they
might not be the person you think they are. Deal with the reality that behind those friendly, loving eyes
lives a gray slug.
That’s what a Yeerk looks like in its natural state. Just a gray slug. They enter your head,
squeezing through the ear canal, and flatten themselves out to envelop your brain.
You know all those nooks and crannies in brains? You’ve probably seen pictures in school.
Well, the Yeerk forms itself into those nooks and crannies and it ties into your mind.
You wake up and you want to scream, but you can’t. You can’t scream. You can’t move your eyes
or raise your finger or make yourself walk. The Yeerk controls you.
You’re still alive. You can still see what’s happening. Your eyes move and focus, but you’re not
moving them. You can still hear your own mouth speaking and using your voice. You can feel it when
the Yeerk opens up your memories and looks through them. You can hear the Yeerk laughing at you as
it pries into your every secret.
I know. Been there. For a few days, I was a Controller.
The Yeerks are here, all right. Their mother ship is parked in high orbit right now. It’s hidden
from human radar, but it’s there.
And the Yeerk super-evil leader, Visser Three, is there, too.
We are being invaded. We are being enslaved. We are losing our own planet. And we don’t even
know it.
My friends and I fight the Yeerks. But we’re just five kids. Well, five kids and one Andalite. Yes,
we have some amazing powers, but we’re still desperately weak and outnumbered compared to the
force of the Yeerk invasion.
We are the only humans resisting the Yeerks.
We may be the only hope that Earth has.
We have a lot on our shoulders.
Which is why I really, really, really did not see why I had to have more suffering piled on.
Wasn’t I under enough stress? Life wasn’t bad enough? We had to have … square dancing?

My name is Rachel.
I won’t tell you my last name or where I’m from. Here’s what I can tell you about myself: I’m
tall for my age. Maybe tall for any age. I have blond hair. I like gymnastics, shopping, and a good
fight with bad guys. Not necessarily in that order.
People say I’m pretty, and I guess I’m okay. People say I’m self-confident, and I know that’s true.
My closest friends think I’m fearless. They’re wrong about that. People without fear are just
insane. I have plenty of fear in my life. Some days I feel afraid from the minute I wake up in the
morning till my last nightmare at night.
But the thing about fear is you can’t be afraid of it. I know that sounds confusing. I guess what I
mean is, be afraid if you have to, right? Fear is like this vicious little worm that lives inside you and
eats you alive. You have to fight it. You have to know it’s there. You have to accept that you’ll never
get rid of it, but fight it just the same.
Brave isn’t about not being afraid. It’s about being scared to death and still not giving in.
That’s all any of us do. Any of us Animorphs. We just try not to give in.
And in the middle of it all, in the middle of all the danger and betrayal and fear, we try to hold
on to what’s normal and good. Have to keep up with the homework. Have to be ready for that pop
quiz. Have to still listen to music and watch TV and maybe go to a movie.
You know what I mean? When you live in an insane world, you have to hold on to the little
things.
There are six of us. Five humans, one not-so-human. There’s me; there’s Jake, my more
responsible cousin; Marco, my personal pain in the butt; Cassie, my best friend forever; Tobias, who
was our first casualty, trapped forever in the body of a hawk; and Ax, the only Andalite to survive
their mission to Earth.
It all began with an innocent walk through an abandoned construction site at night. The five of us,
minus Ax, were minding our own business, heading home from the mall. No one was thinking, Hey,
let’s get ourselves in the middle of an interstellar war. I just wanted to get home, do all those normal
things. Maybe watch TV
. Check out some Web sites. Listen to a favorite CD. Do my homework.
Whatever. Normal stuff.
But the damaged Andalite fighter landed right in front of us, and from that point on, nothing was
normal again.
We are not alone in this universe. There are billions of stars and billions of planets. And on
some of those planets, life arose like it did here on good old Earth.
On some of those planets, highly intelligent life evolved. Just like Homo sapiens - humans -
evolved here. Out there in the stars, there are races like the Ellimists who are so advanced they make
humans look as dumb as cows. Then there are races, like the Andalites, more advanced than us. You
know: like a tenth-grader is more advanced than an eighth-grader. But still in the same zone of reality.
And there are races like the Hork-Bajir, razor-bladed killing machines that everyone says used
to be rather sweet. And the Taxxons … well, what can you say about the Taxxons? Huge cannibalistic
centipedes. Not exactly the good guys of the galaxy. Not exactly nice.
And then there are the Yeerks.
The Yeerks, who enslaved the Hork-Bajir. The Yeerks, who made a devil’s deal with the
Taxxons. The Yeerks, who spread throughout the galaxy like a virus, attacking one race after another,",Ani 12.0 - The Reaction - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

My name is Tobias.
The other Animorphs can’t tell you very much about themselves, but I can. See, I don’t have an
address. I can’t be found. I live in an area of forest by a meadow. That’s my territory.
My territory includes the meadow, which is maybe a hundred yards across in one direction, and
half that in the other direction. My territory also includes the trees around the meadow, and the woods
heading north for about another hundred yards.
Of course, my territory is also the territory of other animals. Owls, jays, foxes, raccoons, on
down to ants and spiders. But no red-tailed hawks.
Except me.
My name is Tobias, and I am human. Partly. Most of my mind is human. At least I think it is. I
mean, I remember human things. I can read and use language. Most of my close friends are human.
And I was born a human, in a human body with arms and legs and hair and a mouth.
Now, though, I have wings and talons and feathers. And instead of a mouth I have a hooked beak.
I can make sounds with my beak. But nothing that sounds human. To speak with regular humans I
use thought-speak.
But there were no people nearby right then in the early morning, as I waited patiently in the
branch of a dying elm tree.
I kept my eyes focused sharply on the meadow. I knew the pathways and homes of the mice and
rats and rabbits who lived there. And I knew what it meant when the tall, dry grass twitched just the
smallest bit.
With my hawk’s eyes I could see what no human could hope to see. I could see the individual
stalks of grass barely tremble as a mouse brushed between them.
And with my hawk’s ears I heard the faint sound of mouse teeth, chewing on a seed.
The mouse was seventy or eighty feet away. An easy target.
I opened my wings slowly, not wanting to make a sound. I released the grip of my talons on the
branch and fell forward. My wings caught the cushion of air and I swooped, almost silent, toward my
prey.
The grass twitched.
Through the grass I saw a flash of brown. The mouse was running.
Too slowly.
I raked my talons forward. I swept my wings forward to cancel my speed, dropped one wing to
turn, and fell the last foot like a rock.
It was all over very quickly.
But this time as I dragged the mouse away to a safer spot, I stumbled on a faded magazine
someone had thrown away. The wind whipped the pages by, one at a time. Advertisements. Graphs.
Pictures of the president with some foreign leader.
And then one page stayed open. A photograph of a classroom. Kids my age. Some of the kids
were goofing off in the back of the class. Some looked bored. Most looked more or less interested,
and three were practically leaping from their seats, waving their hands for the teacher. All that, frozen
in a photograph.
A classroom like any classroom. Like the classrooms I used to attend. I would have been one of
the kids paying attention, but too shy to volunteer. I was never very bold or aggressive. I was a bully-",Ani 13.0 - The Change - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

My name is Cassie.
I can’t tell you my last name. The Yeerk danger is too great. There are days when it feels like a
noose slowly tightening around my neck. There are days when I don’t feel like I can trust anyone. But
as long as they don’t know for sure who I am, maybe my friends and I can stay alive. Maybe.
Kind of dramatic-sounding, right? I sound like maybe I’m paranoid or nuts, don’t I? Well, trust
me, I’m not being overdramatic. I’m probably the least dramatic person you’ll ever meet. And I’m not
one of those crazy conspiracy people or anything. Really.
I’m just an average girl. I’m not some supermodel or rock star or whatever. I’m short. Okay-
looking, but definitely not beautiful. I’m more stocky and solid than tall and willowy. If you want tall
and willowy, you’ll have to meet my best friend, Rachel.
But that’s not me. I’m a short girl with short black hair and no makeup and a wardrobe that runs
the gamut from jeans all the way to overalls. I own two pairs of boots. Both are currently covered
with mud and various kinds of animal poop. I also have a couple of nice pairs of rubber gloves. You
don’t even want to know what’s all over them.
See, I work with animals a lot. I help my dad, who’s a veterinarian. He runs the Wildlife
Rehabilitation Clinic, which is actually just our barn. He takes in all kinds of injured wildlife and
sets their broken legs, and heals their mange, and soothes their burns, and disinfects their bites.
I help him out after school and on weekends. Mostly I do things like give the animals their
“meds” - that’s medications. I wash the animals and their cages, and feed them, and change dressings,
and help my dad out in surgery. He’s teaching me how to suture. You know - how to make stitches
after you perform surgery.
Cool, huh? At least, to me it is. But in any case, now you know why I own poopy boots and gross
gloves and several pairs of torn, stained jeans.
What can I say? I will not be appearing on the cover of Seventeen.
On the other hand, Rachel is my best friend, and Rachel is without a doubt the coolest person I
will ever know. And Jake likes me - as in likes - and he’s the smartest, strongest, most balanced
person I’ve ever met. Except maybe for my parents, who are cool but in a parental way.
So anyway, I guess the lack of a decent wardrobe hasn’t set me back too much. One way you can
judge a person is by looking at their friends … and their enemies. I have wonderful friends.
And terrible enemies.
I have the kind of enemies that no normal, short, fashion-impaired animal nut should have.
Earth is being invaded. It is being invaded by a species of intelligent parasites called Yeerks. In
their normal state they’re just these grayish slugs. Like big fat snails without their shells. But the
Yeerks have the ability to enter the brain of another animal, wrap themselves around the brain, sink
into all the little cracks and crevices, and utterly take over.
The Yeerks have already enslaved the entire Hork-Bajir race. They’ve made allies of the vile
Taxxons. And now they are after us.
They’re here. They’re all around you. You just don’t know it. They can be anyone. You think you
know your friends? Your teachers? Even your parents? Maybe you do. But maybe you don’t. Because
any of them might have a Yeerk living inside their head. Any one of them might be a Controller.
That’s what we call a person who is enslaved by a Yeerk. A Controller. A human-Controller,
which is a human who is completely enslaved by the Yeerk in his or her head.",Ani 14.0 - The Unknown - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

My name is Marco.
I’ve always kind of liked my name. Marco. It brings Marco Polo to mind. Not that my last name
is Polo. Or maybe it is. I’m not going to tell you.
None of us will tell you our last names. None of us Animorphs. Or where we live. Or anything
else that would help the Yeerks find us.
Yeerks? What are Y
eerks? you wonder.
I’ll tell you. They are a species of parasites. Like tapeworms, only worse. See, Yeerks don’t just
crawl up inside your stomach or intestines. They crawl inside your brain. They sink their malleable
bodies into the nooks and crannies of your brain. They tie straight into your brain’s neurons. They
control your brain. They control you more completely than it is possible for you to imagine.
You think, Oh, well, I would still be able to keep control over myself. But you’d be wrong. See,
if you had a Yeerk in your head right now, it would be the Yeerk that would be moving your hands and
fingers; the Yeerk who’d be focusing your eyes; the Yeerk who’d be deciding if you were hungry.
The Yeerks enter your brain and make you a slave. They open your memories and read them like
a book. You can still think, sure. You can still feel. You can be afraid or angry or humiliated. But you
can do nothing on your own. It is a slavery more total than any ever experienced on Earth. But then,
the Yeerks aren’t from Earth.
People with Yeerks in their heads are called Controllers. Human-Controllers, if the Yeerk has
taken over a human. Hork-Bajir-Controllers, when the victim is a Hork-Bajir. Although pretty much
all Hork-Bajir are Controllers, so we don’t really bother to say “Hork-Bajir-Controllers.”
We fight the Yeerk invasion led by the evil creature, Visser Three. Five human kids and an
Andalite kid. We’re the only people who know what’s happening. Just us. And the Yeerks, of course.
And how do we fight? With the morphing power given to us by a dying Andalite prince. The
power to become any animal we can touch.
The power to morph.
How do you know who is a Controller and who isn’t? That’s the problem. You don’t. You can
look deep into the eyes of the person you trust most and never, ever guess that behind those eyes is an
alien parasite.
Now you know why I won’t tell you my last name. Or where I live. Not even what state. See, I
want to live. I want to live to fight.
And one day, I want to live to rescue the one person who matters most to me. The person whose
eyes I looked into for years without knowing she was no longer my mother.
But being an Animorph is not always danger and battle. There are other times when the powers
we possess can be useful. Even fun.
And on a nice Wednesday afternoon after school, I was at the mall with the others, doing just
that: having fun. And we weren’t at the usual, everyday mall. This was the new, massive Mega Mall
they’d built across town.
It was Cassie’s idea, oddly enough. Normally she’d be the last person to ever cook up a
harebrained scheme. But this involved mistreating animals. And you don’t want to mess with animals
when Cassie is around.

Just Jake. I can’t tell you my last name.
My name online is Bball24. At least, that’s close to being my real online name. I have to be
careful, even about that. See, nothing is safe from the Yeerks. I could give you my actual screen name
and they could find me.
That would be the end of Jake and Bball24. All my friends. And, just maybe, the entire human
race.
You want to know what my screen name means? Well, I used to be really into basketball. I tried
out for our team but didn’t make the cut. But my best game ever I scored twenty-four points. So that’s
what Bball24 is about: basketball, twenty-four points.
Kind of dumb now, I guess. Basketball isn’t all that important to me anymore. And not just
because I didn’t make the team. It’s just that I’m playing a much more intense game now.
I’m an Animorph. It’s a made-up word. You won’t find it in any dictionary. My best friend
Marco came up with it. It’s short for “Animal Morpher.”
It’s what we are, thanks to an alien who died trying to save the people of Earth. He gave us the
power to morph. To become any animal whose DNA we could absorb through touch. We use this
power to fight the Yeerk invasion of Earth.
That’s another word you won’t find in the dictionary: Yeerk. But the word has a terribly real
meaning. The Yeerks are a species of parasitic slug. Yeerks live in the brains of other species. They
live inside Taxxons, inside Hork-Bajir, inside Gedds, and I guess inside a few Leerans. And,
unfortunately for all the free races of the universe, they live inside the brain of one Andalite.
They live in the brains of humans, too. Human-Controllers. That’s a human who isn’t exactly
human anymore. A human-Controller is a slave to the Yeerk in its head.
How many humans have the Yeerks infested? We don’t know. Too many. My brother Tom is one
of them. Marco’s mother is one. Our assistant principal at school is one. We’ve seen human-
Controller cops, human-Controller teachers, and even a TV star who wanted to become a human-
Controller - weird as that may seem.
They are everywhere. They can be anyone.
And that’s why we fight. That’s why we undergo the nightmarish transformations into animal
form again and again. Because our only weapons are the animals we become.

You want to know my last name? Too bad. I don’t give out my last name. No offense. I’m not
trying to be difficult or “too cool.” I’m just being careful.
Here’s the situation. Earth, our little blue and green planet, the one with the fluffy white clouds
and all, is under attack.
It’s not under attack like in some World War II documentary or something. Or like in Star Wars.
It’s more subtle than that. Not a lot of explosions and ray guns or whatever. In most wars, I guess what
people are after is control of land or territory. Or at least they want to ram some idea down some
other person’s throat.
In this war, our enemies don’t care about land. They don’t care about ideology. They don’t want
to take over our capital city and raise some flag or whatever. They want us. They want our physical
bodies.
They are called Yeerks. They are a race of parasitic slugs. Like tapeworms or something. They
need to live in the bodies of other creatures. Otherwise they’re just these gray slugs who slosh around
helplessly in a Yeerk pool.
But unlike a tapeworm or something, Yeerks don’t live in your intestines. They don’t infest your
stomach. It’s your brain they infest.
They enter through your ear. They can squeeze and flatten themselves out to fit into very small
spaces. They enter your ear and then your brain. They squeeze and ooze down into all the little gullies
and ridges and folds of your brain. And then they interface with your brain. They control you. Totally,
absolutely.
They can open your memories anytime they want. You have no privacy. None. No secrets. None.
No escape. None. They are inside your dreams and thoughts and whims and wishes and desires.
Your brain becomes theirs. They own it. They lift your arms and bend your waist. They aim your
eyes and focus on what they want to see. They eat for you. They go to the bathroom for you.
And because they have total access to your every single thought, they can pass for you.
Flawlessly. They can be you, while always remaining themselves. Your friends will never know.
Your mother and father will never know. You will be alone, trapped, helpless, paralyzed in your own
body. Unable to make the simplest decision for yourself. Unable to stop yourself when you betray the
ones you love. Unable to warn those whom the Yeerks target next.
A Controller. That’s what we call a person who has been taken over by a Yeerk. A human-
Controller. Although other species around the galaxy have already fallen to the Yeerks.
The Hork-Bajir are enslaved. The Gedds. The Taxxons, although those vile, evil worms did it
voluntarily. And we’ve learned the Yeerks are moving against a race called the Leerans.
And they are moving against Earth, where people live their normal lives never knowing. I guess
it’s like having cancer or something. You never know the tumor is growing inside you till it’s too late.
So now you know why I’m cautious. Why we hide our true identities.
And who are we? We are Animorphs. Five kids given the power to morph into any animal we
can touch. Five kids who just had the bad luck to be there when the Andalite prince Elfangor landed
his damaged ship. Five of us and Elfangor’s little brother, the Andalite Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill.

I don’t know if my fellow Andalites will ever recognize that name. I guess some of the story I’m
about to tell will appear in the scientific journals. I mean, the accident that occurred to me has
certainly rewritten the science of Zero-space mass extrusion during morphing.
But I doubt that my real name will be used. I doubt that the whole truth will be told. And I guess
that’s a good thing. You see, there are traitors among us. Yes, traitors among our fellow Andalites.
Andalites working for the Yeerks.
I am the only living Andalite witness to the Ascalin incident. Only I - and my human friends,

I know it seems impossible even to conceive of Andalites as traitors. I know the very idea
makes any decent Andalite sick inside. But I am telling the truth. The Ascalin incident happened. We
were betrayed by one of our own.
My name is Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill, brother of Elfangor-Sirinial-Shamtul. And I swear by his
memory that everything I say here is true.
I am the only Andalite presently located on planet Earth. Don’t bother looking Earth up on any of
the databases. You won’t find much information. The truth is, we lost a Dome ship in orbit above this
planet. The Yeerks destroyed it. We lost my brother, Prince Elfangor, in that battle, too. But before he
died, Elfangor broke our law and gave the secret Andalite morphing power to five human youths.
The Yeerks are after this planet now. They are invading Earth in their usual style. The Yeerk
parasite slugs have an easy time entering human heads, wrapping themselves around human brains.
Enslaving humans as they did the Hork-Bajir and the Gedds. As they hope someday to do to us.
I live among these humans now. With the group of young humans who were given the morphing
power by Elfangor. They call themselves Animorphs. They resist the Yeerk invasion of Earth. All
alone, as far as we know.
I live with humans. I respect them. But my hearts are still Andalite. No matter what anyone ever
says about me and about what happened on Leera, I am true to my own people.
And yet there are times when I wonder: Who are my own people? My race, my species? My
family? My friends? My allies?
My human friends insist on reducing my name to “Ax.” You see, humans communicate by making
mouth-sounds. (most Andalites understand the concept of a “mouth,” I believe.) And although my full
name is easily pronounced in Andalite thought-speak, it is somewhat long and complex for primitive
human mouth-sounds.
I am alone on this planet. The only one of my species. The only Andalite among all the humans.
So I have used the morphing technology to create a human morph. And sometimes, for two hours at a
time, I become human and pass among humans as one of them.
I am very good at passing for human, if I say so myself. I have learned the customs and habits
perfectly so that I seem entirely normal.
That’s how I am able to pass even in the most human of places. For example, the mall. Which is
a place full of shops, most of which sell artificial skin and artificial hooves. Technically known as
“clothing” and “shoes.”
The mall also houses the most wonderful eating places. You see, in addition to making sounds",Ani 18.0 - The Decision - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

My name is Cassie.
I am an Animorph. That’s the name we made up for ourselves. Or actually, it’s the name Marco
made up for us. I’m not that clever with words.
I wish I was more clever with words. I really do. Because the story I have to tell is too strange,
and in some ways too beautiful, for me to tell very well.
But I’ll do the best I can. And later, when I can no longer tell the story, Jake will take over.
Here’s what you need to know to begin with: We are not alone in the universe, we creatures of
Earth. We humans are just one of maybe thousands of thinking, reasoning species. There are seven or
eight that I know of for sure, ones that I have personally seen: Humans, Andalites, Yeerks, Hork-Bajir,
Taxxons, Leerans, Gedds, Chee. And the Ellimists, if you can call them a species.
Among these species, the Yeerks move like a virus. They are parasites. Like intelligent
tapeworms. They enter a body, wrap themselves around the brain and take over complete control.
Complete control. The poor creature who has been infested loses all power over his own
actions. He loses all privacy. His memories are like a bunch of videotapes that the Yeerk can play
whenever he wants.
We call a human who has been taken over that way a Controller. The Hork-Bajir have all been
made into Controllers. Well, almost all. The Taxxons, too. The Gedds.
And now the Yeerks are after the human race. They have invaded the body of the human race like
a virus. Like a cancer. Unseen, unsuspected, growing, spreading, enslaving… .
I guess you’d call them evil. I always did. An evil race. An evil species.
And I guess you’d say the Andalites are the opposite. The Andalites fight the Yeerks. It was a
brave Andalite prince who broke his own laws to give us the power to morph. It’s the only power we
have to fight the Yeerks.
This is what I believed: that the Yeerks are evil. That the morphing power is all we have.
So I should have been glad to be able to fight the Yeerks. I should have been glad to have the
morphing power.
I should have been glad… .
<Cassie! Behind you!>
It was night. I was the wolf. I spun with far-more-than-human speed. I saw the Hork-Bajir’s
clawed, bladed foot slash toward me.
I jerked aside.
The foot landed in the dirt beside me, missing me by a hair. One inch to the left and it would
have opened me up like a sardine can.
The Hork-Bajir was off-balance now. All his weight was on that foot. I could see the muscles
rippling. I could see the tendons straining.
I lunged. I opened my jaw wide. I closed my teeth on those muscles, on those tendons, and I
clamped with all the shocking power the wolf possessed.
I twisted my head savagely, ripping, tearing, trying to do damage.
“Rrrraaawwwr, raaawwrrr, rrrr!” I vocalized as I bit down. I repositioned, bit down again, and
twisted and twisted, shaking my shoulders to help rip and tear.
The Hork-Bajir screamed in pain.
He tried to slash at me, but now he was off-balance in the other direction. He was falling back,",Ani 19.0 - The Departure - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

My name is Marco.
Her name is T’Shondra.
Isn’t that a beautiful name? A beautiful name for a beautiful girl. Which is what I told her as I
sidled up casually to her locker.
“T’Shondra,” I said.
“Marco,” she said.
“A beautiful name for a beautiful girl,” I said.
“What is? Marco?”
“No, T’Shondra.”
“What?”
“T’Shondra. I was just saying I thought it would be a beautiful name for a beautiful girl.”
“Oh, really!” she said, giving me serious fish-eye. “It would be, huh? For a beautiful girl. But
not for me, huh? Is that what you’re saying? You just came all the way over here, acting all cool, to
tell me I should give my name to some beautiful girl because I’m too much of a pig to have the
name?”
At this point I could have explained. But I had this bad feeling that the moment was past. You
know? Like nothing I could possibly say was going to make this work.
“How about if we just say this conversation never happened?” I suggested. “How about if I just
turn and walk away?”
“That would be a good idea.”
Now, where was I? Oh yeah, my name is Marco. And I can’t tell you my last name or where I
live. Why not? Because I’m hoping to live long enough to figure out females, that’s why. I mean, is it
just me, or are they way too sensitive?
The other day I’m talking to this girl named Danielle. And she happens to work out a lot, so she
is very strong. But in a good way. In a good way, I emphasize. So I say to her, “Whoa, Danielle,
you’re looking way buff. Look at those shoulders of yours. You could practically be a boy.”
What does she do? Does she say, “Thanks, Marco, for paying me a compliment”? No. She calls
over this guy she likes, this guy named Justin Mullins, and says, “Marco just said I look like a boy!”
Well. The end result was me running down the hall yelling, “I meant it in a nice way! Stop
chasing me. It was a compliment!”
But that’s beside the point. I’ve been chased by worse than Justin Mullins. I’ve been chased by
Hork-Bajir warriors. I’ve been chased by Taxxons. I’ve been chased by Visser Three himself.
Here’s the thing you need to understand: Life isn’t what you think it is. There are things going on
that you don’t understand.
Earth is being invaded. By some not-nice creatures called Yeerks. They are a parasitic species,
like tapeworms. Only they get into your head, not your stomach.
They control you. Utterly. Totally. You’re the Muppet and they’re the hand. We call people like
that Controllers. That’s what you are when you’re nothing but a human puppet under the control of the
Yeerk in your head.
They are everywhere. They can be anyone. You’ll never know for sure. Your dad, your mom,

My name is Jake.
And I was one sorry cockroach.
<Aaaaaahhhhh!> I yelled as I twirled and fell and spun downward toward the ground far below.
Not that I could see the ground. Cockroach eyes are strictly for close-up work. And they’re not
even good at that.
So I couldn’t see the ground thousands of feet below. Nor could I see Marco, Cassie, Ax, and
David, also cockroaches and also falling through the air.
I could hear them, though.
<Aaaaaahhhhh!> Marco yelled.
<Aaaaaahhhhh!> Cassie agreed.
Only Ax was silent. He’s an Andalite. They don’t scream quite as much as humans. It’s not that
they’re braver, it’s more that they’re a telepathic species. So I guess they just didn’t evolve to do a lot
of screaming.
<We’re gonna dieeee!> David yelled in thought-speak panic.
<I do not believe the impact will kill us,> Ax said. <I don’t believe our mass is sufficient to
cause death when we impact.>
<He’s right!> Cassie cried. <You can’t kill a cockroach by dropping it. Not even from this
high.>
<Unless that’s water below us,> Marco said. <In which case we could hit the water and get
chomped by some big hungry fish.>
<Should we demorph?> Ax wondered.
<No time,> I said. <We’d get bigger, more mass, and then when we hit we’d ->
I stopped falling. In an instant something hit me. But it hit me going sideways. A gigantic talon
closed around me.
<That is you guys, right?> Rachel’s thought-speak voice asked calmly. <I mean I figure,
cockroaches falling through the air, gotta be you guys.>
<Yeah, you seldom see cockroaches at a thousand feet up,> Tobias agreed. Rachel and Tobias
had not been aboard the spacecraft. The spacecraft that had kidnapped the president’s helicopter. The
one we’d fallen out of. In cockroach morph.
Maybe I should back up and explain.
It all began when we discovered that the blue box - the morphing cube - had been found by a kid
named David.
Well, no, actually it all began much earlier. Months ago, when Marco, Cassie, Rachel, Tobias,
and I happened to be walking home from the mall by way of an abandoned construction site.
Which is where we saw the damaged spacecraft landing. And where we met Elfangor, an
Andalite prince. Elfangor was dying. His enemies, the Yeerks, were hot on his trail. He was out of
time.
So he did something Andalites don’t usually do: He trusted some non-Andalites. Namely, the
five of us. He told us that Earth was being invaded by a race of parasites called Yeerks.
The Yeerks are slugs, really. Not very impressive-looking or scary. But they have the ability to
enter a brain - almost any brain - and take control of it. Absolute, complete, total control.

My name is Rachel.
And I was deep in this strange dream that seemed to involve me trying on dresses at my favorite
department store. Only the salesladies kept bringing me things that were way, way too small.
So I said, “Hey, can’t you tell these aren’t my size?” And the saleslady said, “Well, we don’t
have anything in your size.”
“What?” I demanded. “You don’t have anything in size three hundred and twelve?”
Wait a minute, I thought. I don’t wear size three hundred and twelve. But at that moment I caught
sight of myself in the mirror. And I was in my elephant morph.
I was still growing. Bigger and bigger, till my massive bulk was pressing people against the
walls and floors and ceiling.
I looked down, and there, beneath one massive fold of elephant belly, was a small figure in an
orange hooded sweatshirt.
“Oh, my God! She killed Kenny!” someone cried.
“Aaaahhhh!” I screamed.
“Try Juniors on the second floor,” the saleslady suggested. “Only please don’t use the elevator.”
And then she leaped at me and started digging her fingernails into me. They were really sharp.
So I got mad and I shoved her. Only when I shoved her, she suddenly wasn’t a saleslady at all.
She was a bird.
“Aaahhh!” I yelled, sitting straight up.
There, in the darkness of my room, the large gray bird fluttered back and knocked into my desk.
“Tobias?” I whispered. Only it wasn’t a red-tailed hawk. It was like a hawk, but gray and white.
<No, it’s Aximili. You must come now. Tobias is … missing. And Prince Jake is in danger.>
I threw back the covers and my bare feet hit the floor. “What?”
<It’s David. He is a traitor.>
I was fully awake. Wide-awake and already mad. I grabbed some throw pillows and shoved
them under the blankets. Hopefully they would look like me asleep if my mom came in to check on
me.
I glanced at the clock. Late. V
ery late. So late it was early.
I quickly ran through a list of possible morphs. I had to be able to fly. And it was night. I focused
my mind on the image of a great horned owl.
I began to change, even as I hammered Ax with questions.
“What happened?”
<Jake, Tobias, and I watched and waited outside Cassie’s barn. As you know, Jake suspected
David might have decided to turn against us.>
“That weasel! That slimy nyeeerrrrrff.”
My tongue had shrunk rapidly in the middle of telling Ax what I thought about David. Probably
for the best. Ax would have asked me to define the word I was about to use, and that wouldn’t have
been a good idea.
I was shrinking all this time, of course. And the brown feathers were appearing on my skin. First
as outlines, then as weirdly realistic tattoos, then, quite suddenly, as actual three-dimensional
feathers.

22.5,The Hork Bajir Chronicles,Applegate,"Prologue
My name is Tobias.
I was restless. Don’t ask me why, I just was. So I flew.
There were no Animorph missions planned. The others didn’t need me right then. So even though
the sun was going down, I flew.
I flew toward the mountains. Toward the secret, hidden valley the Ellimist had showed me.
Even now I had trouble finding it. Even though I knew exactly where it was. Even though, as a
red-tailed hawk, I had vision far better than any human.
The Ellimist had concealed the valley from human eyes. How? Who knows? The Ellimist could
hide all of planet Earth if he wanted to.
But knowing where the valley was, I could find it with some effort. I found the narrow gap
between two ridges. I was not fooled by the way my eyes kept sliding away from the gap, as if some
negative magnetism was at work.
I flew as the sun dropped and the air cooled and the lift beneath my broad wings failed. I had to
flap harder to stay aloft. Stupid, really. Now I’d have to spend the night here in the valley.
Then, below me, I saw a sight that made me glad to be there. A strange creature like nothing
Earth has ever given birth to. It was four feet tall. There were razor-sharp blades at its ankles, knees,
wrists, and elbows. There were two long, forward-raked horns coming from its head. It had a tail that
ended in Stegosaurus spikes.
A young Hork-Bajir.
A young, free Hork-Bajir.
It was swinging, leaping through the trees like a monkey or a squirrel. Running through the tree
branches, but happy-running, not scared-running.
I’d played a small part in the Ellimist’s plan to create a free colony of Hork-Bajir. Not that the
Ellimist interferes in the lives of other species.
So he claims.
Right.
In any case, the other Animorphs and I had played a role in helping two escaping Hork-Bajir
find their way here. Jara Hamee and Ket Halpak. Like all Hork-Bajir, they had been infested by
Yeerks. They’d been slaves of the Yeerks.
Somehow they had escaped. Don’t ask me how. Ask the guy who doesn’t interfere in the lives of
other species.
They’d had a baby. That was him … or her … cavorting beneath me. I still was not very good at
telling the difference.
Hork-Bajir don’t live as long as humans. So they grow up faster, too.
I increased my speed and outraced the Hork-Bajir child. I found the nest of caves, six or eight,
all close together, where we’d figured the Hork-Bajir would live.
But to my surprise I could now see that the caves were unused. The adults were in the trees. But
not just Jara Hamee and Ket Halpak. There were a dozen or more Hork-Bajir there now. All free.
Many starting to raise families.
I realized then that I had not accidentally headed toward the hidden Hork-Bajir valley. It had
been deliberate, even if it was subconscious. I’d been feeling kind of down. But now, seeing this
fragile community of free Hork-Bajir … well, how can you see freedom replace slavery and not feel",Ani 22.5 - The Hork-Bajir Chronicles - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

My name is Tobias.
That’s my name. But names don’t really tell you much, do they? I’ve known two Rachels. One
was this whiny, obnoxious person. The other Rachel - the one I know now - is the bravest person I’ve
ever known.
But you’d think that my telling you my name is Tobias would at least tell you that I’m human,
wouldn’t you? You’d assume I have arms and legs and a face and a mouth. But names don’t even tell
you that.
I am not human.
I was human once. I was born a human. There are human characteristics within me. And I can
become a human for two hours at a time. But I am not human.
I am a red-tailed hawk. A very common species of hawk, nothing exotic. Red-tails tend to live in
woods near an open field or meadow. We hunt best that way: by sitting on a tree branch, gazing out
across the field, spotting prey, then swooping in quickly for the kill.
That’s what I do. I live in the trees near a very nice meadow. Unfortunately, the hunting has been
bad lately. Partly that’s just the way it goes. There are good times and bad times in the predator
business.
But more, it’s competition. Another red-tail has been moving in on my territory. He’s been eating
my mice. Between him and the minor drought we’ve been having, food’s getting a little scarce.
Stupid, huh? Stupid that I’d worry about something like that. I mean, I have powers far greater
than that other red-tail. I can morph to human. I can morph to any animal. I could morph to some
member of the feline family or some kind of snake and take out the red-tail.
Only I don’t.
I could confront the other hawk. Red-tail to red-tail. We could fight it out.
Only I don’t.
I don’t do anything. Pretty soon he’ll make a move on me, push me aside. Maybe then I’ll have to
figure out what to do. But right now, I don’t do anything. I just go hungry.
I could go to the others for help. To Rachel and the other Animorphs, my friends. But how weak
is that? How can I go begging for help to deal with a situation I should be able to handle myself?
I sat on my branch, in my tree, and watched the dry grass. I watched as only a hawk can watch.
With telescope eyes and a mind that never grows tired of looking for the clues to a kill.
I waited and watched and listened. A twitch of a grass stalk. A slight puff of rising dust. The
faint sounds of tiny feet scrabbling in the dirt.
And from time to time I looked across the meadow at him. At the other hawk. He was a hundred
yards away. The length of a football field. But I could see him clearly. It was like looking in a far-
distant mirror. The angry, yellow-brown eyes. The wickedly curved beak. The sharp talons dug into
the bark of a branch.
He looked at me. Our eyes met. He was pure hawk. I was … I was that unique, misfit creature
called Tobias.
<No,> I said to him, though of course he understood nothing. <No, I won’t use my morphing
powers against you. It will be me and you. Hawk against hawk.>

My name is Cassie.
There are a lot of things about me that I can’t tell you. My last name, for example. Or my
address.
I live in a paranoid world. I wish I didn’t, but I do. And I have no choice but to conceal, to lie,
to mislead. Even while I am desperately trying to tell the truth.
You must know the truth. You must accept what is happening to Earth, to humanity. Because only
by knowing can you fight the terrible evil that is upon us.
I am referring, of course, to the Yeerks.
Not to the Helmacrons.
The Yeerks are a parasitic species from a far-distant planet. They originate in an aquatic
environment. A Yeerk pool. At some point in their evolution they moved out of the safety and sensory
deprivation of the pool and evolved an ability to enter the brains of a species called Gedds.
For a long time, millennia, maybe, they were content to go that far. They did not know about
space travel or technology at all. Like humans, they did not know of the existence of other species in
the galaxy.
At least, that’s what our Andalite friend, Ax, tells us. I’m sure it would be fascinating to study
the evolution of the Yeerk species. Kind of like it must be fascinating to study cholera or typhoid.
Study with care. Because as far as humans are concerned, the Yeerks are disease. They are
spreading throughout our population.
They enter through the ear canal. They have the ability to thin out their bodies, displace the
portions of the inner ear that are in the way, and drill into the skull. There they flatten their bodies out,
sinking into the crevices on the surface of a human brain.
They tie into the brain. Like you or me accessing a computer with a keyboard. They can see all
of your memories. They know all of your thoughts. All.
And they can control you utterly and completely. They move your hands. They move your feet.
They aim your eyes and tilt your head and make that familiar smile everyone knows is yours alone.
We call them Controllers. The slaves of the Yeerks. The Hork-Bajir people were the Yeerks’
first great alien conquest. Then they infiltrated the Taxxons. They have had skirmishes with a dozen
other species. But now they are after their greatest prize: Homo sapiens.
Humans. Humans, with fingers more delicate and capable than any Taxxon or Hork-Bajir or
Gedd. Humans, who could be fed almost anything, unlike the bark-eating Hork-Bajir or the eternally
ravenous, cannibalistic Taxxons. Humans, who exist in numbers far greater than all those species
combined.
We are the perfect host bodies. Not as dangerous as a Hork-Bajir can be, but infinitely more
adaptable.
Billions of unaware, skeptical human beings. We look, to the Yeerks, like Aztec gold looked to
Cortés. We could be the solution to all their problems. We could give them the sheer numbers to
explode from Earth and ravage every other species in existence.

That’s me.
I can’t tell you my last name. I can’t tell you where I live, either, or anything specific about me
that might help certain people find me.
Believe me, I wish I could. Anonymity has its downside. Last week, for example, I wanted to run
through the halls of my school screaming my name so everyone could hear. I wanted to hop on a
cafeteria table and dance on somebody’s Tater Tots until a hall monitor came to drag me away. I
wanted to call an assembly so everyone could congratulate me.
I’d gotten a date.
And not just any date. A date with the most beautiful girl in our whole school. If not the whole
world.
Marian.
Not only is Marian gorgeous, with long, black hair, deep, dark eyes, and dimples that make me
want to cry every time she smiles. She’s also nearly as smart, charming, and charismatic as I am.
You can see we’re a perfect couple. The only flaw I can find in her is that she doesn’t seem to
think my jokes are very funny.
That, and her taste in music.
You want to know the coolest thing of all about this date? Marian asked me out. I didn’t have to
do a thing. We were just leaving our music appreciation class together when Marian said to me:
“Wow, Marco, you really seem to know a lot about classical music. And may I say, you are an
unusually handsome, manly man. I want you, I want you now.”
Okay, that maybe a slight exaggeration. But she definitely said the part about me knowing a lot
about music.
“Either that, or I can scam teachers like no one else around,” I said.
Actually, I know next to nothing about classical music. But my dad’s got a huge collection of
classical CD’s. Sometimes he’ll hog the TV
, watching documentaries about Mozart and Beethoven
and other wild-eyed guys.
“Well, I have tickets to Symphony Hall this Sunday afternoon,” Marian said. “They’re playing
Beethoven’s Third. It’s my absolute favorite symphony. Do you want to come?”
“Well, I’m more of a fan of his thirty-third,” I said, hoping I wouldn’t pass out at her feet. Marian
had just asked me out on a date!

“Of course! It’s a joke, hah HAH!” I said, sounding only slightly hysterical. “I love Beethoven’s
Third. It’s just so …” I wasn’t sure what to say. I’d never heard the thing before in my life. Marian
looked at me eagerly, waiting for me to finish my sentence.
“It’s just so …”
“Beautiful?” Marian suggested.
“Yes!” I replied. “That’s a perfect word for it. Although I was leaning toward exquisite. Maybe
even rapturous.”

The dream came again. As real as it always was.
The Yeerk was in my head once more. He was starved of Kandrona rays, weakening, failing. I
was watching him die.
The Yeerk cried in pain again and again. And the memory visions came floating up as clear as if
they had all just happened.
They were visions of the Yeerk’s life. And the lingering memories he had stolen from his hosts.
One of those hosts had been my own brother, Tom.
I felt each of those minds in my own as the Yeerk gave up his life. I was the caretaker of those
memories of despair.
At the end, the Yeerk was no longer in pain. He was beyond pain.
I opened my eyes and looked at Cassie. It happened so naturally. I opened my eyes by my own
will for the first time since I’d been infested.
And then, for the first time in more than an hour, the Yeerk spoke. <So. You win … human.>
The Yeerk shuddered. I could feel it as a physical spasm. My vision changed. And I felt
something impossible to describe. I felt as if I were seeing through things. Into things. Like I could
see the front and back and top and bottom and inside of everything all at once.
It was as if I had slipped out of the normal world. Out of the real universe. I was in a different
reality. I was peeking through a tear in a movie screen. On the surface, the three-dimensional movie -
my world - played. Beyond it … something my mind could not comprehend.
In my dream, my dream of memory, I felt the terror grow. I knew what was coming next. I
writhed in my sleep, twisting my sheets around me. Wake up! Wake up!
But I could not wake up. I never could, not till the dream was complete.
And so I saw it again.
A creature. Or a machine. Some combination of both. It had no arms. It sat still, as if it were
bolted down, on a throne that was miles high. It could not move, and yet the power that flowed from it
was like a hurricane of energy.
Its head was a single eye. The eye turned slowly … left … right …
I trembled. I prayed it would not look my way.
And then it saw me.
The eye, the bloodred eye, looked straight at me.
Through me.
It saw me.
It SAW me!
No! NO! I cried in silent terror. I tried to look away, but my eyelids were transparent, my head
would not twist far enough to avoid its gaze.
It spoke the single word it spoke only in my dreams.
And now, at last, I could awaken, shaking in a sweat-soaked bed.
Why? Why would this dream not go away? I’d had other nightmares, other awful memories of
fear and violence that needed to be exorcized in my dreams.
But they had each faded. While this dream came again and again.
I got up and staggered into the bathroom. I snapped on the glaring fluorescent light. Then I
stepped to the sink and looked at my face, my head.",Ani 26.0 - The Attack - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,
27,The Exposed,Applegate,"Chapter 1
My name is Rachel.
I’m tall. I’m blond. And I’m standing on a balance beam, trying to get up the nerve to do a
forward roll.
Trying to be normal.
Although when you think about it, what’s normal about a human somersaulting along on a
slippery, narrow, wooden tightrope?
Nothing, that’s what. Forget the forward roll.
Hey, reckless in battle keeps me alive. Reckless in the gym just breaks bones.
And to keep fighting, I need to stay in one piece. Survival always comes first. So you know I
won’t tell you my last name or where I live. That information would get me and my friends killed.
Not that we’d go down without a fight, of course, but still …
We’re five kids and an Andalite who, as I see it, have to hold on to the three major things we’ve
got going for us.
The ability to morph by acquiring animal DNA.
Anonymity. Nobody knows who we are.
The home team advantage.
So far, it’s been enough to keep us alive and to seriously aggravate the Yeerks, a parasitic
species here to enslave Earth.
If the Yeerks had a “Most Wanted” list, we would top it. They want us bad. Maybe they’d kill us.
Maybe they’d do what they’ve done to so many humans: crawl into our heads and take over our
brains. Make us Controllers.
A Controller is someone enslaved by a Yeerk, and they’re everywhere. They’re people you
know. People you trust.
Our vice principal, Mr. Chapman.
My cousin, Tom.
Teachers, TV anchorwomen, cops, FedEx drivers, waiters, students, construction workers. All
walking around like they’re perfectly normal. Persuading their friends and families to join The
Sharing, the Yeerks’ cover organization.
And once you’re in, there’s usually only one way out.
You become a Controller.
You walk and talk the same. You have the same memories. You still chew gum in class and toss
brussels sprouts back into the serving bowl when you think your mother isn’t looking.
Only it isn’t you doing any of it. The real you is caged up inside your head, helpless, screaming
silently at the Yeerk slug holding you hostage.
Become a Controller, and you have no will of your own.
I will never surrender my free will.
This is why we fight. And to be honest, I like a good fight. The adrenaline spike of battle. The
rush. The challenge.
And now that I’ve admitted that, I’ll admit something else: Lately, it’s been scaring me that I like
it. That I look forward to it so much.
My father thinks I’m as tough as any boy. My cousin Jake says my specialty is kicking butt.

My name is Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill.
It is not a human name. It is an Andalite name. Not that humans reading this are likely to know
what an Andalite is. I am the only one here on Earth.
No, that is not completely true. There is one other. But he is not the Andalite he once was. He is
now the host body to the Yeerk who holds the rank of Visser Three. Andalites call him the
Abomination.
My duty is to someday destroy him.
I am only an aristh, a cadet. But as any Andalite who ever reads this will know, Andalite custom
demands that I avenge my brother’s death. Elfangor was a warrior and prince. Visser Three murdered
him.
I suppose I thought that Elfangor would live forever. He was fearless. Honorable. Perfect. It was
a lot for a brother to live up to because I am not any of those things.
But the memory of my brother is why I look forward to the day when I destroy Visser Three. It is
not simply a matter of duty. I cared very deeply for my brother.
And I am not the only one who wants to destroy him and the other Yeerks who have invaded
Earth. Before he died, Elfangor gave five human youths the power to morph. As well as the truth
about why they need this power.
Now these five humans are the only ones resisting the Yeerk invasion. Fighting to stop the Yeerks
from enslaving the entire human race. Fighting to stop them from crawling into human brains and
taking over all thoughts, actions, and memories.
They are also the only ones who know about me.
They are my people now - the only people I have here, so far from home. I am grateful for their
friendship. I respect them, too, which might be more important. But Tobias is the only one I might
consider a true shorm.
A shorm is a deep friend, someone who knows everything there is to know about you. The word
comes from the Andalite’s tail blade, which looks something like what you may know as a scorpion’s
tail. A shorm is someone you would trust to put his tail blade against your throat.
Even though Tobias does not have a tail blade - or hooves, stem eyes, and fur, the way Andalites
do - he is almost one of us. Elfangor was his father, and, as strange as it is to think of, I am, in Earth
terms, Tobias’s uncle.
But I think it is the fact that he is almost as unique on this planet as I am that makes us close.
Choosing life as a red-tailed hawk has set Tobias apart from everything he once knew.
We are both unique on this planet, and both very much alone.
There are times at night, as I search the dark sky for the home star, when I think about my real
people, my family. I think about a life that might have been very different from the one I am living
now, here on a distant planet, far from everything I once knew.
The others, Prince Jake, Cassie, Rachel, and Marco, all have homes and families. Only Tobias
and I do not. Tobias lives in a meadow that is his territory. And I, until recently, did not even have that
limited amount to call my own.
But now I have made my life a bit more comfortable. I have constructed a sort of scoop - what
we Andalites consider to be a home.
Like any scoop, it is mostly open, with only a small area covered by a semi spherical roof. And",Ani 28.0 - The Experiment - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,
29,The Sickeness,Applegate,"Chapter 1
My name is Cassie.
I wish I could tell you my whole name. Because that would mean I was a nice, normal girl. But
I’m not either one. Not nice. Not normal.
Okay, my friends think I’m nice. Marco is always calling me a tree-hugger. And even though I
don’t actually hug trees, I do care about them. Which makes me nice, right? A girl who cares about
trees can’t be anything but nice.
Unless that girl has also ripped a living creature’s throat out with her bare teeth. Which I have.
I was in wolf morph, deep in battle. Seven Hork-Bajir against six of us. Jake gave the order to
retreat. And either right before he said it, or right after, I yanked the throat out of the Hork-Bajir I was
fighting.
I hope it was right before. I hope that I didn’t go in for the kill when I could have just run. But
I’m not sure.
That’s why I don’t think I qualify as nice. You’ve probably already gotten a clue why I don’t
qualify as normal.
Here’s the short version: An Andalite prince named Elfangor gave the power to morph to me and
four of my friends. He knew he was about to die, and he didn’t want to leave Earth defenseless
against the Yeerk invasion.
He showed us a small blue box. We pressed our hands against it. And we were changed.
This morphing cube was lost for a while. Now we have it again. We’ve used it once, to add an
Animorph to our group.
Then we had to subtract that new Animorph. And we’ve kept the blue box hidden ever since.
Since that night in the construction site, since that change, the five of us, plus Elfangor’s younger
brother, have been fighting the Yeerks.
Yeerks are parasites. A Yeerk enters a host through the ear canal, flattens itself out on the brain,
and takes over completely. The host creature can’t scratch an itch unless the Yeerk wants it to. We call
a being who has been taken over that way a Controller.
You must be thinking the Yeerks are pure evil. But let me tell you what it’s like to be a Yeerk
who isn’t in a host. Yeerks are basically gray slugs. No hands, no legs, no eyes, no ears.
If a Yeerk wants to be free, free to really move, free to see the beauty of the world around it, free
to hear music or even the sound of rain on leaves, if a Yeerk wants that, it has to have a host. If a
Yeerk wants to be free, it has to make another living creature a slave.
Not an easy choice, is it?
I know something about hard choices. I’ve made a lot of them since I became an Animorph. And
one of the hardest was whether I wanted to be an Animorph at all. Because I know that when - if - this
whole thing is over, it may be too late for me to be either nice or normal ever again.
Like I said, I know something about hard choices.
“So, Cassie, here’s your choice. If you were on a desert island, who would you want to be with
you - Baby Spice or Marco?” Rachel asked as we sat down at our usual lunch table.
“Huh?” What else could I say to that question?
“It’s the desert island game,” Rachel answered. “You pick two annoying people. Then you have
to choose which of them you’d rather be on a desert island with.”

Okay, listen up. It’s Jake. You probably already know what’s going on around here. But just in
case you don’t, here’s the deal: Rachel, Tobias, Cassie, Marco, Ax, and I are five kids and one alien
out to save the world.
No, this isn’t a joke. It’s real. About as real as you can get. Real enough for screaming
nightmares about the things you’ve seen and done.
Because sometimes the stuff you see in the movies, the stuff you thought could never, ever
happen to you … well, it can happen. It does happen. I’ve seen it.
I can’t tell you my last name. Or where I live. There’s an alien invasion going on. Right here on
Earth. But I’m not talking little green guys with ray guns. I’m talking a much smarter way to conquer a
world. Just invade people’s brains.
I’m not nuts. I’ve seen it. And because of that, my friends and I were given a special power - the
power to morph into any animal we touch. To acquire its DNA. It’s the only way we can fight the
Yeerks - that’s what they call themselves. We have to find a way to stop these slugs that get into
people’s heads and make them slaves.
But things have gotten worse. We need backup. A new Animorph. We’ve tried this once before
and it didn’t work out. At all. We’re going to try again. So, if you’re interested in joining us, let’s go.
Just remember not to read this missions like a normal book. Check out the instructions and follow
them.
You get to choose your morphs, but I’m warning you now - choose them very carefully. You have
to deal with the consequences. They can either help you, or get you totally annihilated.
This isn’t a game. It’s serious stuff. So if you can handle it, turn to the next page.

It was happening again. Unbelievably, it was happening again.
A woman was drowning. Not the dreaded leader of an alien force. Just a woman. Alone in a
roiling sea. Defenseless. Vulnerable.
My mother.
There was no way I could let it happen again.
I powered toward her. My arms strained with each stroke. My legs kicked wildly.
Hold on. Hold on!
So close. Close enough to see her straining to keep her head above the cold black water.
Then I was on her, one arm around her shoulders, the other paddling madly to keep us afloat.
“Hold on!” I cried. “I’ve got you!”
She looked up at me, wet hair plastering her face. Then she spoke. “Thank you, Marco.”
“Mom …”
“I’m free, Marco. I’m free!”
And then a powerful current swept her out of my grasp and sucked her under the glittering
surface of the midnight ocean.
“No! No, no, no!”
I dove. The salt stung my eyes. I pushed deeper and deeper into the darkness. My lungs ached but
I would not allow it to happen again. I would not let her go! Not when she was free. Not …
“NO!”
“Marco? Are you okay?”
I shot up straight as a board. Where … ? My bed, my room. My father.
I put my hands to my head and looked at the picture of my mother that sat on my nightstand.
“You okay?” he repeated.
No. I wasn’t. “Yeah. Yeah. Bad dream, I guess.”
“About her?”
I swallowed hard. “Yeah.”
Dad sat on the edge of my bed and hugged me.
I returned the hug weakly. Patted him on the back.
“I’m okay, big guy,” I said. “What time is it?”
“About time to get up and get going,” he said. “I get the shower first. I have to be in early today.”
I watched my father leave the room. But instead of getting out of bed and heading downstairs for
a bowl of Honeycomb, I sat amidst the tangled, slightly damp bedcovers, too exhausted to move.
My name, as you probably know by now, is Marco. And that was how my Friday started. Not the
greatest way to greet the last day of a long week. But not exactly uncommon. Dreams of fear and loss
and despair.
Before I lost my mother to the enemy, before I learned of the Yeerk invasion of Earth, my life
was pretty tame. Mostly I worried about things like whether I’d dropped enough hints at dinner about
which Sega disk I wanted for my birthday.
Not about things like the enslavement of the human race.
Those were the days. Or, as Dad says, “The salad days.”

My name is Jake.
Just Jake.

Where I live and go to school don’t matter, either.
What matters is that we’re in a war, fighting for the survival of the human race.
You’re thinking Y
eah, right. That’s okay. I know - I probably would have said the same thing
once.
No way. Not a chance. If it’s true, then where are the troops storming the beaches? Where are the
bombs? Where’s the battlefield? The RPVs and cruise missiles?
Well, it’s not that kind of a war.
The battlefield is wherever we are, we being my friends and I. We are animal-morphers, given
the ability to absorb DNA by touch and then morph into that animal. It’s an incredible weapon, the
kind that both dreams and nightmares are made of.
Ask Tobias, who stayed in his red-tailed hawk morph longer than the two-hour limit and now
spends his days catching and eating small mammals.
Or check in with any one of us in the small hours between night and morning, when the
nightmares come, the nightmares of twisting bodies and mutating minds.
Like I said, this is not your standard-type war.
We’re the whole army, the six of us. We get some help from the Chee, but they are incapable of
violence, so when it comes to the down and dirty, we’re it. Us, alone, against an alien empire that has
already terrorized the galaxy.
Yeah, I know. Nice odds.
Most of us learned to fight the hard way in a deadly, on-the-job-training-type deal.
But some of us had a head start, like my cousin Rachel, who loves it all. And Ax, whose full
name is Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill, warrior-cadet and younger brother to Elfangor, the Andalite who
gave us the power to morph before he was murdered by Visser Three.
I know, sounds like bull, right? Sounds like maybe I need to spend some time in a rubber room.
But it’s true. Every now and then the crazy becomes real.
And this is not a clean war, if there is such a thing. I mean a war like World War II, where
thousands saw the wrongs being committed and stood up to correct them. Where you attacked an
enemy you could see, an enemy who wore a uniform and came right back at you, guns blazing.
This isn’t that kind of war at all.
The Yeerks are more subtle than that. They aren’t predators, they’re parasites. They don’t want
to destroy humanity, they don’t want to make big piles of bodies, they need our bodies in one piece to
continue their invasion.
See, they’re basically slugs. Parasites. No arms, no legs, no face. Blind.
That’s why they need host bodies.
They slither into your ear, seep into the crevices of your brain, open your memories.
And you’re still inside yourself while it’s happening, trapped, helpless, begging for the
nightmare to end.

Joke. Sorry, I’m not very good at jokes.
Here’s what you need to know: Earth is under attack. Earth is being invaded. Yes, by aliens.
I know. It sounds like fiction. It sounds like something you’d hear from the crazy lady pushing the
shopping cart full of cans down the street. I wish I had a more believable story to tell but all I can do
is tell the truth.
The truth is that Homo sapiens, humans, me and you, have been targeted by an alien species
called Yeerks.
They’re a parasitic species. Not predators looking to kill, kill, kill, hovering over our cities and
blowing up the Statue of Liberty or whatever. The Yeerks don’t want us dead. They don’t want our
land or our natural resources. They don’t want to barbecue our livers.
What they want is us.
They’re nothing but gray slugs in their natural state. Helpless. You could put on your
Timberlands and stomp a couple thousand of them on the sidewalk.
Except that the Yeerks aren’t content to live as slugs. They infest healthy host bodies, they enter
the brain, they wrap themselves around the brain and sink into the little crevices. They control the
brain. Utterly.
Once they have you, once they’ve made you a Controller, you don’t focus your own eyes, or
move your own fingers, or draw your own breath. You are powerless. Like being totally paralyzed,
only your eyes are still seeing and your mouth is laughing and your hands are reaching out to choke the
life from someone you love.
They’re here. They’re not E.T. They’re not cute. And we, my friends and I, are the only people
who know, and just about all that stands between the Yeerks and total world conquest.
Wow. Depressing, huh?
Fortunately, we are not powerless. The Yeerks aren’t the only aliens with an interest in Earth.
There are the Andalites as well. Night and day. Evil and not evil.
The Andalites may not all be saints, but one of them, a warrior named Elfangor, gave us the
Andalite technology that allows us to morph. To acquire the DNA of any animal we touch and then to
become that animal.
Morphing: power wrapped up in a nightmare.
And yet, there are times when morphing has certain advantages beyond fighting the Yeerks in
their various host bodies.

And I don’t think I could have felt more uncomfortable if I’d just been asked to give an
impromptu speech on the French Revolution in front of an all-school assembly.
Well, okay. I guess that would be pretty bad. But this Friday night was definitely right up there.
Back when I was a regular kid, school dances made me a little uneasy. I’ve always been a loner
and all, and they just weren’t my thing. But now! Now that I spent most of my life as a red-tailed
hawk - hunting, flying, protecting my meadow - dances made me feel even weirder.
Bird-boy at the ball.
Why had I let Rachel talk me into this? I mean, what do you do with your arms? They just
dangled there. Stiff. Awkward. And my eyes! I’d fix a stare on someone and forget, until it was too
late, that people tend not to do that. A big, burly redhead noticed as the raptor in me burned a hole
through his girlfriend.
“Jerk!”
Oops. Hard to remember I wasn’t perched in a tree a half mile away.
I’d been cool enough at the last school dance. That was more of a group thing, I guess. Tonight it
was … I don’t know … a date? No, no, no. We were all there. Pretending to be acquaintances.
I looked ridiculous, I was sure of it. And I was sure that everyone else thought so, too.
Did Rachel?
I glanced at her. She seemed impatient. Angry almost, as she surveyed the dimly lit gym in an
absent yet determined way. They’d taped some helium balloons to the bleachers and draped strings of
multicolored lights from the basketball hoops. We were down at the far end next to the deejay. So
close to the speaker my eardrums were numb.
Rachel was as beautiful as ever. Really. I mean I wouldn’t tell her this, but she made the other
girls look pretty plain. Her gold hair gleamed in the strobe light. Her bright eyes caught mine. I knew
she wanted me to dance with her. I just couldn’t do it. My human body was sweating. I felt confined. I
needed air. I looked away.
Did I mention that my name is Tobias?
Just Tobias. Even if it were safe to tell you my last name, I’m not sure I’d know what to say.
Whether it would be a human name, an Andalite name, or just “Hawk.” I don’t know. Because, see,
I’m a little of each.

My friend Marco unlike me, was in paradise. He was belting out lyrics like his first name was

He slide-stepped toward us, spun around and stopped, squealing his sneaker on the gym floor.
He froze with one finger pointed at me and one at Rachel.
She glared at him “Some kind of chemical imbalance, Marco?”
“Hah. Hah. And also a bonus hah,” He grinned “This is a natural high. A good music high. A
lots-of-girls-in-short-skirts high, A people laughing high. This is fun. Do you two remember fun?”
Rachel caught my eye again. Again I looked away, up at the clock. Twenty minutes left in morph.
Not much time.

probably wouldn’t give me a second look. Unless it was one of the days when I had a little bird poop

But I really am your basic, average girl. A first and last name plus middle initial kind of girl.
Except for the fact that I spend most of my time trying to stop the Yeerk invasion of Earth.
That’s why I can only tell you my first name. If the Yeerks knew my last name, I’d be dead. No,
worse than dead.
Let me give you the Cliffs Notes version.
Fact: Yeerks are alien parasites that have the appearance of small gray slugs. They enter their
hosts through the ear canal, then spread their soft bodies into the crevices of their hosts’ brains.
Fact: The Yeerks have already enslaved many species, including the Hork-Bajir, the Gedds, and
the Taxxons, although the Taxxons submitted willingly. Now the Yeerks have targeted the entire human
race for use as hosts.
Fact: You already know someone who is controlled by a Yeerk. You just don’t know you know
someone who is controlled by a Yeerk. Yeerks can access their hosts’ memories and make them act
exactly the way they always have. A human host, called a Controller, cannot move a single muscle
unless the Yeerk in his or her head gives the order.
Fact: The Animorphs may be your only hope of escaping becoming a human-Controller yourself.
The Animorphs are me and four of my friends - Jake, Rachel, Marco, and Tobias. A great
Andalite prince named Elfangor gave us the power to morph into animals. He knew he was about to
die, and he didn’t want to leave Earth completely defenseless against the Yeerks. Later we were
joined in our fight by Elfangor’s younger brother, Ax. Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill.
Usually the six of us work as a team, but tonight I had a secret mission, and I didn’t want too
many people around. I asked Rachel if she’d be my backup, and of course she agreed.
You should see Rachel. She’s like Stone Cold Steve Austin crossed with Miss Teen USA. Unlike
me, Rachel is someone who could pull off the whole I’m-so-special-I-only-need-one-name deal even
if she didn’t have to keep her identity a secret.
“So are we going in or what?” Rachel asked me.
I stared up at the old Victorian house. A single light burned in one window. A loose shutter kept
swinging back and forth on its hinges. The screeching sound made the hair at the back of my neck
prickle.
“We’re going in,” I answered, ignoring the prickling sensation.
“This plan of yours is … what’s the word I’m looking for?” Rachel asked. “Oh, yeah. Insane. As
in Looney Toeowww -”
Rachel’s words turned into a high meow. Her vocal cords had started to change first.
“We have to do this,” I told her as her nose narrowed and sprouted fur. “It’s life and death.”
I watched Rachel for a few more moments. She was going to use her cat morph to go into the
house. I was going to use my rat morph. I figured it couldn’t hurt to give her a little head start. That
way she’d be in total control of her cat brain before I became all small and delicious.",Ani 34.0 - The Prophecy - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

Your dad being in love with someone who isn’t your mother is a pretty normal problem, I guess.

Yeah, well, boo hoo. Sorry, kids. But you have no idea about the weight of the world. ‘Cause it’s
on my shoulders.
See, not only do I live with a lovesick father. I’m also trying to save the world from being
enslaved by evil, parasitic aliens.
To which you respond, “Ooooookay, dude forgot his medication.”
I’m not crazy. And not lying. I’m telling the truth.
They’re called Yeerks. They’re from another galaxy. Gray, sluglike creatures that slide into your
ear, flatten out inside your brain, and take control of your mind and body. Forcing you to do anything
they want. Anything.
Right now, their invasion is a secret. V
ery few people know about it. Most of the people who do
are their slaves. We call them Controllers. I don’t know how many people the Yeerks have turned into
Controllers. I don’t think I want to know.",Ani 35.0 - The Proposal - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

“Honey?”
No answer. My husband was watching a game on television. He was preoccupied.
“Honey?” I repeated, adding more urgency to my tone of voice.
He looked over. Smiled sheepishly. “What’s up?”
“Marco’s fever is down. I think he’s basically over this thing. He’s asleep. Anyway, I was
thinking of getting some fresh air.”
He muted the television. “Good idea. It’s tough when they’re sick, huh? Kids. He’s okay, though,
huh?”
“It’s just a virus.”
“Yeah, well, take some time, you’ve been carrying the load. And if you’re going to the store -”
“Actually, I think I’ll go down to the marina.”
He laughed and shook his head. “Ever since you bought that boat … I think Marco has some
competition as the favorite child in this household.” He frowned. “You’re not taking it out, are you?
Looks kind of gloomy out.”
I made a smile. “Just want to make sure it’s well secured, check the ropes and all.”
He was back with the game. He winced at some error made by his preferred team. “Uh-huh.
Okay.”
I stepped back, turned, and walked down the hall. The door to Marco’s room was ajar. I paused
to look inside. I almost couldn’t do otherwise because the other voice in my head, the beaten-down,
repressed human voice, was alive and screaming and screaming at me, begging me, pleading <No!
No! No!>
Marco was still asleep. Or pretending to be. A good-looking kid, but small. Already, in his early
adolescence, the stamp of failure was on him. He was too sweet-natured and trusting to ever make it
very far in a hard world. A world that would only grow harder for humans.
Much harder, if I had my way.
I looked at him, one last time, as the voice in my head kept begging and begging. <Let me at least
say good-bye, let me hold him one last time, let me kiss him, oh my God, no, no, don’t do this!>
But that was only a voice. The voice of someone who no longer had a say in what I did with this
body, this life.
I left the house. I drove the car to the marina.
The wind was coming up. Earth really does have fascinating weather. So many different
permutations. Blazing heat and brain-numbing cold; storms that bring violent winds or driving snows
or rains so heavy they blot out all light.
I climbed out of the car and sauntered jauntily along to the boat, a small sailboat tied up halfway
down the pier. Much bigger boats were tied up on either side. That was okay. I had all the boat I
needed.
I climbed aboard and cast off the lines. I winched up the mainsail and took the tiller. I didn’t use
the engine, not even for getting out of the marina. Anyone could guide a powerboat. It took skill to
sail.
Sailing was one of the best things about being in a human. It was such a perfect blend of power
and subtlety, bending to the inevitable and yet resisting great forces. Dangerous and exhilarating. You
skimmed along between sea and sky, a part of each, trusting neither.",Ani 35.5 - Visser - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

A phone call at three A.M. is rarely a good thing.
When you’re an Animorph, the chance of good news ever - day or night - is zero.
“Jake?”
Cassie’s voice sounded shaky. Frightened.
“What’s up?” I said, my own voice casual. At the same time praying that no one else in my house
had picked up the phone. “Those math problems giving you a hard time?”
Cassie forced a laugh. “No. Just can’t sleep again. You know, same old thing.”
“Try counting sheep. I bet before you get to thirty you’ll be asleep.”
“Good idea. Thanks, Jake. See you.”
Cassie hung up the phone.
I had a half hour to get from the subdivision where I live with my family to the farm Cassie
shares with her parents.
Who knew when I’d be back. Forget about getting any more sleep.
I stripped off my pajamas in the dark.
Opened my window wide.
Gave one last glance over my shoulder at the closed door of my bedroom. No lights on in the
hallway. Good.
Then I looked out at the star-studded night and concentrated on the image of a bird.
Peregrine falcon.
I began to shrink. From a normal human kid, maybe a bit larger than average, to a one-foot-high
human kid.
I heard my internal organs changing. A squirmy sound, like a rumbling stomach, a sound you feel
more than hear.
It’s a big change going from human to bird. Nothing ends up where it starts out. You go from a
system designed to eat a bit of this and a bit of that, all well-chewed, to a system designed to swallow
whole mice and poop out the bones and fur.
My own bones, my big, solid human bones shrank and hollowed out. Finger bones relatively
longer, leg bones shorter, breast bone huge.
My skin tightened over the new skeleton. Flesh melted, ran together, like hot wax. I had wings
instead of arms. Skinny legs and dangerous talons.
Gray-and-white feather patterns etched themselves onto my still semisoft skin, then raised into
three dimensions.
Fleshy human nose and mouth blurred, ran together, then extended out to become a hard beak. My
eyes became smaller in absolute terms, but much larger in relative terms.
I was ready.
I hopped onto my desk. From there, onto the windowsill. And then I flew.
My name is Jake.
We’re not supposed to like it, this power we have. We being me, my best bud Marco, my cousin
Rachel, Cassie and Tobias and Ax. We’re not supposed to like it, but mostly I do. This power to
morph. To touch an animal and by doing so acquire its DNA. To become that animal at will.

uncertain human hands this power is both a privilege and a curse.",Ani 36.0 - The Mutation - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

My name is Rachel.
There’s a person in the Bible named Rachel. I don’t know if my being called Rachel has anything
to do with her. I doubt it. I’ve never seen my parents reading the Bible.
There’s a Rachel on Friends. What’s up with this season’s stringy hair? Weird.
And there are, at any given time, approximately five Rachels in my school. At least two of whom
are failing phys ed.
Maybe your name is Rachel, too.
It’s a popular name. Lots of girls have it. Even girls who can manage to throw a basketball
through a hoop from the foul line.
But I’m different from every other Rachel you’ve ever met.
And it’s not just because the dorkier kids in school think I have a seriously bad attitude. Which I
do. So what?
My being different from every other kid named Rachel is not necessarily a good thing. Or a bad
thing. It just … is.
Sometimes - very rarely - I wish I were just one of the thousands of Rachels out there living an
average life. One of the mass of average kids in average middle schools in average, all-American
towns.
Actually, I wish that very, very rarely. I’m not thrilled with average. I don’t do average well.
It’s only when I’m seriously exhausted that - for about half a second - I wish I were just an
ordinary Rachel. Like when I’ve been going on no sleep for forty-eight hours. When I’ve been
slashing and shredding the enemy and leaking blood from my own gaping wounds until I can hardly
breathe without it hurting. When the very thought of sleep seems totally foreign.
Sleep? Huh? I don’t wish it after a typical, everyday kind of mission. Just after the really
annoying ones. The ones where we lose more than we gain. The ones where we fail to do any serious
damage to the Yeerks.
Then, I wish - for about half a second - I were nobody special.
That I’d never stumbled onto the tragic sight of a dying alien warrior prince.
That he’d never told us about the Yeerk invasion of Earth. That he’d never chosen us - me, my
cousin Jake, my best friend Cassie, Jake’s best bud Marco, and this shy, compelling kid named Tobias
- to adopt the noble Andalite mission.
That he’d never given us the gift and curse of Andalite morphing technology. The ability to touch
an animal and absorb its DNA, all for the purpose of becoming that animal when necessary.
To fight off the invaders. To stave off the fate that has befallen so many other worlds through-out
the universe.
A fate worse than death.
Total subservience to a mind-controlling master race.
You know what really infuriates me? This powerful enemy doesn’t even stand on its own two
feet.
The Yeerks are a race of parasitic slugs. No ears, eyes, mouths. No arms or legs. Just gray,
viscous flesh. And the repulsive ability - need, really - to attach their otherwise helpless bodies to the
brains of sentient creatures. To slither into the head through the ear canal. To flatten, lengthen, press
themselves into every crevice and wrinkle of the brain. Like clay being pushed into a mold.",Ani 37.0 - The Weakness - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

Crumph! Crumph!
The thudding of fists against human flesh is not a pleasant sound. It is particularly sickening
when heard through a metal pipe. The sound echoes and is magnified.
“That’s enough. Stop it,” a human voice commanded. The sound was muffled, vague, indistinct. I
was feeling the voice through my six legs, through my antennae.
“But he’s told us nothing,” a second human argued.
I should not call them humans. They are human-Controllers.
There is a difference.
Human-Controllers are humans whose bodies have become hosts to the Yeerk invaders.
Yeerks! Foulest creatures of the universe. Gray slugs who enter the body through the ear, fit
themselves into the human brain, and take over. Mind and body.
Of course, not all hosts are human.
Visser Three, leader of the Yeerk Earth invasion, has an Andalite host.
My name is Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill. I am not human. I am Andalite. The only Andalite among
the group that calls itself the Animorphs. Four humans. A red-tailed hawk. Me.
We are the resistance. We fight the Yeerk invasion until help from my home planet arrives. Or
until we die.
The latter possibility seems ever more likely.
It would be unwise to tell you very much more. The Animorphs and I have many secrets to keep.
And I, as an Andalite, have the secret of my own race to keep.
Crumph!
The sound again. Had we not been on the pipe we would not have heard it. Roaches feel
vibrations. The pipe carried those vibrations directly to us.
We were making our way up a corroded, rusty metal pipe within the interior wall of a two-story
office building. Our mission, to rescue our friend and collaborator, Mr. King. We had all seen the
front page article on The Sharing, the Yeerk front organization. We had been suspicious that the paper
had become yet another Yeerk-run organization. Mr. King had thought it safe to break into the offices
of The Chronicle and examine their computer data, find the truth.
Apparently that was a mistake.
“Talk!” human-Controller Two shouted. “What are you doing here? Who are you? Why are you
snooping?”
Crumph!
“I said stop it!” human-Controller One repeated angrily. “If you kill him, Visser Three will
execute us for wasting a potential host body.”
There was a long pause before human-Controller Two spoke again. “Visser Three will execute
us for incompetence if he finds out we couldn’t beat the truth out of a mere human. Let’s kill him and
incinerate the body. Visser Three will never learn that we failed.”
“Visser Three will wonder why we did not simply infest him and learn the truth.”
“I tell you there is something wrong with this human. I tried to enter the ear canal, but it’s
blocked in some way. You don’t believe me, you try it!”

My name is Cassie.
And you wouldn’t know it to look at me but I’m in the middle of a violent war to save Earth from
an alien, parasitic species called the Yeerks.
Well, most of the time I am. Right now I was kneeling in the barn, waiting for an injured mouse’s
curiosity to get the better of him. And when it did, when he crept out from beneath the cage he’d
scurried under, I was going to scoop him up and take a look at his crooked, back leg.
I guess that’s just me. It’s who I am. I don’t like seeing an animal in pain if there’s something I
can do about it. And I usually am doing something about it, because my parents are vets and I guess
you could say I’m following in their footsteps.
Except that in one way, I’m already way ahead of them.
I’m an Animorph. An animal morpher.
My friends and I were given the ability to acquire the DNA of other creatures and morph them.
This power is the only real weapon we have in our fight to save humanity.
But it’s more than that. For me, at least.
Every time I morph an animal, I experience the world as that animal does, sensing it, sharing its
instincts. That’s knowledge my parents will never have. And I’m not sure not having it is such a bad
thing.
I mean, it’s one thing knowing that a humpback whale can weigh thirty tons but it’s a whole other
story to actually weigh that much. To cruise the ocean with the certainty that you actually are that
animal. The only way to really understand is to become that creature, and they can’t teach that in vet
school.
But this isn’t just about becoming an animal. It isn’t just about the morphing. See, we use our
morphs to fight this war. To divert and battle the Yeerks. That’s why Jake, our leader, doesn’t like us
using the morphs for our own purposes. I can’t say I never have - there’s nothing like frolicking as a
sleek playful dolphin, and being a horse has certainly come in handy on occasion - but I like Jake a lot
- okay, maybe I feel even stronger than “like” - and what he says makes sense, so I try not to do
anything that would put us at risk.
But the risk isn’t the worst of it. This is a war and people die. And using this power to destroy
others is hard to get used to. But as much as I hate inflicting pain and sometimes death on the other
Yeerk-infested species, I can’t just sit back and allow their evil to consume us, the human race, too.
The Yeerks are like a disease, except they spread with malice and intent. A Yeerk will squirm
into your ear canal, flatten out its blind, deaf, sluglike body, and weave into the crannies of your
brain. Tap into your thoughts. See through your eyes, speak with your voice. You are a hostage,
trapped inside yourself. Screaming for help but no one can hear you.
We call people infested by Yeerks Controllers, and there are more of them every day. Like I
said, the Yeerks have taken over other species, too, and they’re using some of them to wage this
poisonous war on Earth.
We, the Animorphs, are the only active resistance. Me. My best friend Rachel. Jake. His friend
Marco. Tobias, who stayed in his red-tailed hawk morph longer than the two-hour limit and now lives
as a bird of prey. A nothlit, as Ax would say.
Ax is an aristh, an Andalite warrior-cadet, and it was his brother Elfangor who gave us the blue
morphing cube before Visser Three murdered him, so that we could continue the battle.",Ani 39.0 - The Hidden - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

Who am I?
Marco.
Not Tuan or Kevin or Rasheed. You know, “Hi, I’m Marco.”
If you yell out, “Hey, Marco!”, chances are good I’ll turn around. Respond. “What?”
You could also say that who I am is far more than a name. That who I am depends on your
perspective. On where you’re standing when you yell out to me.
Like, if you’re standing out in the everyday world - in Red Lobster on all-you-can-eat shrimp
night, on a downtown street corner, or in the mall - you’ll see that I’m slightly less than tall,brown-
haired kid. Come a little close, like into my home, and you’ll see that I’m also a son. A friend. And,
on a very rare day, a decent dogsitter.
If, however, you’re standing in a very particular, very up-close-and-personal spot - like inside
my head - you’ll see that I am, in addition, a few other, less ordinary things.
Defender of Earth, Civilization’s Last Chance for Survival.
Stuff like that.
Generally speaking, I make it a policy not to let people stand in that very up-close-and-personal
spot. Superheroes tend to rack up a lot of dead friends and seriously damaged sidekicks.
That is one reason it’s not a good idea for you to know much more about me than my first name.
The other reason for anonymity is a good thing: the Yeerks.
The Yeerks. If it weren’t for Elfangor, an Andalite war prince, I wouldn’t even know about the
Yeerks, aliens from a far distant planet. Wouldn’t have been enlisted - me, four other kids, and another
Andalite - to fight them. To try and stop their slow but constant infestation of Earth.
See, Yeerks are like slugs. On their own they’re blind, deaf, and mute. But in the brain of a host
body, they’ve got eyes and ears and mouths. They’re parasites, the Yeerks. Living off the minds and
bodies of any creature they deem worth controlling. Gedds. Hork-Bajir. Humans.
And one - only one - Andalite.
Yeerks wriggle their way through the ear canal and into each nook and cranny of the brain. Open
memories, raise hands, move legs. Once a Yeerk is in you head, you’re totally and completely at it’s
mercy. Saying what it wants you to say. Going where it wants you to go. Listening, silently, as it
mocks your every desire and dream. Watching, impotently, as it enlists your mother or father or best
friend into a life of slavery.
The right to privacy? Gone. The privilege of freedom? Gone.
What Elfangor did was give us access to Andalite morphing technology. this is our weapon, the
ability to absorb through touch the DNA of a living creature and then become that creature.
We morph to fight and to infiltrate. To spy on the Yeerk cover organization, The Sharing. And
occasionally kick Yeerk butt.
We become whatever we need to become. Elephant or gorilla or grizzly. Tiger or wolf or
cockroach. Cheetah or polar bear or even Hork-Bajir.
All of which makes that “who are you” question a whole lot more complicated for me than for
say, about 99.9 percent of folks on this planet.
That remaining .1 percent - those would be my friends. The other Animorphs. Jake. Cassie.
Rachel. Tobias, the guy who lives as a hawk. Ax, Elfangor’s younger brother.
Obviously, there are a lot of issues we have to deal with. Issues far too complex for the six of us",Ani 40.0 - The Other - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

My name is Rachel.
Who am I?
Just a kid. A kid with divorced parents and two little sisters. I go to school, do my homework,
hang out with my friends. If you saw me I bet you wouldn’t look twice. Just another suburban mall rat.
Nothing special.
Funny how that sounds like an insult.
I bet you hate being ordinary. I bet you long for something to make you feel different and special.
You’re probably just waiting for something exciting to happen to you.
Be careful what you wish for.
One night something exciting did happen to me. I was given a weapon. A wonderful and awful
weapon. The ability to morph, to change from an average kid into an animal. Into a bird or insect.
Only five human beings possess this weapon. Me; Cassie, my best friend; Jake, my cousin and
our leader; Marco, our own personal clown; and Tobias, our lost soul. Five humans unique in all the
universe. Guess that makes us pretty special.
But along with the power to morph came a mission: Save the world. I’m not kidding. This is no
joke.
See, Earth is being invaded by the Yeerks, aliens with weak, repulsive bodies. Slugs. Parasites.
The Yeerks want our human bodies. Our strong legs and hands. Our sensitive ears, mouths, and
eyes. They are taking over human hosts, entering their brains, controlling them, rendering them utterly
helpless.
So we fight. The five of us humans and Ax, an alien kid. An Andalite. The Andalites battle the
Yeerks throughout the galaxy. A war on too many fronts. One day the Andalites may send
reinforcements to Earth. Until then, we fight alone.
Each battle changes us. Transforms us on the inside as much as on the outside.
War is not a video game. In a real war, you make desperate decisions and deal with desperate
consequences. You spill blood and your blood gets spilled. You brush up against death. You change.
You’re warped until ever being average and ordinary again is an impossible dream.
What would you do if you were given the chance to be different, unique, extraordinary? If
someone offered you the ability to morph, would you take it? And if you did take it, how long do you
think you would survive?
This is your chance to find out.
But I’m warning you. Think about it first. Think deeply. Ask yourself: Can you handle it?",Ani 40.3 - Alternamorphs #2_ The Next Passage - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

“Help me.”
I tried to get up. There was a body lying on me. Hork-Bajir. His wrist blade was jammed against
my side.
I tried to lift up with all four legs, lift the dead thing off me. But I only had three legs. My left
hind leg lay across the bright-lit floor, a curiosity, a macabre relic. Tiger’s paw.
I tried to slide. That was better. The floor was wood, highly polished. Slick with blood, animal,
alien, human. I reached out with my two front paws, extended the claws, and dug them into the wood.
They didn’t catch at first. But then my right paw chewed wood and I gained traction.
A voice said, “Help. Please help me.”
I dragged myself slowly, carefully, gingerly out from beneath the bladed alien. The pain in the
missing leg was intense. Don’t let anyone ever tell you animals don’t feel pain. I’ve been a lot of
animals. Mostly they feel pain.
<Jake? Jake?>
It was Cassie. <Yeah. I’m here.>
With a lurch I was free of the weight pressing me down. I rose, shaky on three legs. Looked
around through the tiger’s eyes.
It was a fabric-cutting room. A design house. You know, dresses no one actually wears. The kind
of stuff you see on Style With Elsa Klensch as you’re flipping channels.
Fashion? Strange front organization for the Yeerks. Why?
There were hugely wide, long tables covered in cloth. One tilted up weirdly, one leg had been
broken off entirely. Kind of like me. There were big rolls of patterned fabrics on that end that
weighed the table down and made it balance, like a seesaw, not up, not down.
Overhead there were banks of brilliant fluorescent lights. Splashes of stylish neon on the bare
brick walls. Bodies everywhere. Blood. Slashes of it.
<Cassie?>
I saw the wolf limp out from behind an overturned cart. She was alive.
I felt a wave of relief. The last I’d seen of Cassie she was in trouble.
In the distance, out through the big doors, down the dark hallway, I heard the hoarse vocals of a
grizzly bear. Rachel. Not fighting, not anymore, just raging, raging. Roaring with the frustration of a
mad beast looking for fresh victims and finding none.
Marco was already demorphed. A kid. My age, but he looked so young to me. My best friend.
He’d demorphed to human because the alternative was bleeding to death from the gash across his
gorilla throat.
Demorph to human. All better. No pain.
“I’m cold. I’m cold, help me,” the voice called.
<Make sure he can’t see you,> I warned Marco.
Rachel came lumbering back into the room, eight hundred pounds of shaggy brown fur and
railroad spike claws and a vaguely quizzical grin that hid sharp canines. <Where’s Tobias?>
I didn’t answer. I didn’t know the answer.
Rachel began shoving and lifting Hork-Bajir bodies. She found Tobias, a crumpled hawk. He
was breathing.

Whummph!
BAAAM!
I slammed the Hork-Bajir into the concrete. Pinned him against the subbasement wall with two
massive tiger paws.
His red eyes burned with hatred. His face was a twisted horror as he pushed back, desperate to
free his tail blade from behind his body.
I strained to reach the scarred, saddle-leather flesh of his neck. To rip out the throat.
By the way, I’m Jake.
Can’t tell you much more than that. Like my last name or where I live. I can’t even tell you where
I go to school. Here’s what I can tell you: Earth is being invaded by parasitic slugs called Yeerks.
Still with me? Pretty hard to believe, huh? See, humans seem to be their latest preference in host
bodies. They take thousands a day. Make them into slaves. They just squeeze into your ear canal.
Wrap themselves around your brain. Tap into your memories and dreams. And then they take over.
You can’t even decide when to blink. No control at all. It’s like your skull becomes a prison. And
you’re trapped in your own head. No way out.
My friends Marco, Rachel, Cassie, Tobias, an alien kid we call Ax, and I are the only active
resistance. So now you’re asking yourself, “How are six kids preventing the total takeover of Earth?”
Well, we were given the power to turn into any animal we touch. To actually acquire the animal’s
DNA. To morph. The Andalite technology was a gift to us from Ax’s older brother, Elfangor. After he
crash-landed, and before he was murdered.
So anyway, we’re the only ones fighting back. We managed to slow the Yeerks down a little. But
it was getting harder to keep up the fight. Harder to keep it together.
“Hhhhhrrroooowwwwrrrr!” I roared.
He faltered and I lunged forward. Missed! His tail broke free and he slashed!
And carved a hole in my underbelly!
I watched, stunned and helpless. Those were my guts, spilling from my body! I froze up for one
instant too long. He pushed me down onto pipes that …
Tsssssssssss!
<AHHHHHH!>
My fur was smoking, my flesh scalded!
Adrenaline cracked through my chest like a whip. I was up again, face-to-face with a Yeerk-
infested Hork-Bajir.
I had one more chance with this guy. This was it. And suddenly the vividness of the scene
seemed to recede.
Don’t get me wrong. My guts were still spilling out of my belly. Exhaustion still pressed on my
shoulders like a granite slab. But I was in a new zone. It was him or me.
Claws bared, teeth flashing, I leaped.

My name is Rachel.
And I was facing down a Controller in a purple-and-pink Dunkin’ Donuts uniform. He was
holding a Dracon beam. Smirking. The little jerk.
Tseeew! Tseeew!
He fired at point-blank range. Hit me right between my three-foot-long tusks.
“HhhhREEEEEuuuhhh!” I roared in pain and anger. Mostly anger. Like a couple of Dracon beam
blasts are enough to take down a thirteen-hundred-pound African elephant.
Yeah, an elephant. I can morph into animals whenever I want. I can also morph a cat and a
cockroach and lots of other animals and bugs. Sounds like fun, right?
Wrong. Like, about one percent of the time it’s not seriously unpleasant. Mostly morphing is a
weapon. A weapon in the most desperate battle ever fought by human beings.
Here’s the deal. Earth is under attack. The planet has been invaded by aliens called Yeerks.
These guys aren’t into exploring strange new worlds. They’re into exploring strange new bodies.
They’re parasites. Like lice or ringworm. Only intensely worse.
In their natural state, Yeerks are nothing but gray slugs. Until they infest a host body, enter the
brain, sink down into the little crevices, and take complete control.
Once they have you, you can’t focus your own eyes, or draw your own breath, or decide when to
pee. You are powerless. A slave of the most complete and hopeless kind.
You can still do one thing. Just one terrible thing: You can watch in horror as the Yeerk in your
head lies to your family, betrays your friends, plots to take over your planet.
Frightening?
Oh, yeah. And it gets worse.
Me and my friends are all that actively stand between the Yeerks and their evil conquest of
humanity. Just a group of five kids and a young alien.
We’re trying to hold on until help gets here from a few billion light-years away. See, the Yeerks
have enemies. A race of amazingly advanced aliens called Andalites.
Andalites look like deer. If deer had blue-and-tan fur, humanoid arms, and scorpionlike tails
tipped with wickedly sharp blades. Andalites also have two main eyes, on their face, and two on
swiveling stalks that sprout from the top of their head. Beautiful and intelligent and cunning.
Not too long ago - who am I kidding, what seems like a lifetime ago - an Andalite ship got fried
right above Earth. Torn out of the sky while battling the Yeerks. My friends and I saw it fall. Saw the
dying Andalite war prince named Elfangor crawl from the wreckage. Listened, stunned and just a
little freaked out, as he gave us the technology that allows us to morph. To acquire the DNA of any
animal we touch and then to become that animal. But there was one rule we had to follow: Stay in
morph for more than two hours and you stay there forever. Become what the Andalites call a nothlit.
Stuck in your morph for the rest of your life. Someone who means a lot to me knows about this
firsthand. He’d stayed in morph too long and now he lives his life as a red-tailed hawk. He did regain
his morphing ability, but when he demorphs he’s not a human. He’s a bird. The sad part - at least for
me - is that he seems to like his life the way it is now.
But even though it seems futile, we’ve been fighting ever since.
Trying to hold on even though we’ve just about given up waiting for any more help out of the sky.

My name is Tobias. Still a freak of nature. Part human. Part bird. Confused? Don’t worry, it gets
better.
I am flying over the forest. The air is thick. A storm is approaching. It is only early afternoon, but
the sky is growing black as the front moves in on the city. A towering wall of rain, wind, and cumulus
clouds.
I had to find food before the storm. I was hungry. But then, I’m always looking for food. That’s
life for a bird of prey. Hunger.
A shrew stepped out from its burrow. It loitered nervously, sniffing the moisture. We had the
same thought, me and the shrew. Hunker down against nature’s wrath, but fill your belly first.
I was higher on the food chain. I tucked into a dive.
My wings pressed tight to my body. Air whistled past. Mountains, forest, and sky. All a blur, a
flashing streak. Everything but the shrew, shifting agitatedly, chomping on a seed …
My talons struck, embedded, and squeezed. Drained life instantly.
Wonder what it’s like? Dig your fingernails into a too-ripe peach. Rip sections off with your
teeth. Gulp them without chewing. The kill is something like that.
I downed the shrew and lifted off.
I don’t think about the kill anymore. I’m hawk and human. I’ll explain later. Just try to understand
that the hawk must feed the human. It has to happen.
I don’t think about it anymore.
That’s a lie.
“Y
ou vile little bird! Do you realize what you’ve done? Do you realize what you’ve become?
Y
ou’re trapped! Y
ou have to live out your life as a bird!”
Her name was Taylor. My Yeerk torturer. Her voice screeching. Bruising my ears. Tormenting
me after every kill. Other times, too. Still, after all this time …
THWOK! THWOK! THWOK! THWOK!
A helicopter! Hovering low over the trees, dispersing terrified crows in all directions. If I were
a true hawk, I’d have cleared out with the other birds. Instead, I circled around and flapped toward
the turbulence.
My friends, the Animorphs, the ones who fight the Yeerk invasion of Earth, say that since my
capture, I live too much of life in my head. They must be right. I’d almost missed everything.
Not just the helicopter. The humans below, streaming across rough forest floor, the tires of their
ATV’s scoring the soil. The searchlights streaking the trees in the daytime darkness, making rabbits
and deer dart in alarm.
I flew to the nearest ranger station. It was ringed by squad cars and TV news vans. I swooped
down, closer to the action. Landed on a low branch. A blond woman in a raincoat held a microphone
close to her lips and swatted windwhipped hair away from her face.
“Bobby McIntire,” she shouted above the noise of the vehicles, “missing now for two full days
since he wandered away from his camping party. Hope that he’ll be found alive is fading. But it’s not
just a race against time and the weather.” Lightning struck the sky above her, imparting urgency to her
words. “Little Bobby is deaf and can’t hear the desperate calls of rescuers. Kelly King,” she
concluded, looking skyward, “reporting live.” She held a frozen, concerned expression until the
producer gave her the all clear.",Ani 43.0 - The Test - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

I swooped low.
This had to be it. Plane at the far gate. Two Marine guards, trying to look casual. Well, as casual
as you can get wearing combat boots and a pistol strapped to your chest.
<Jake, I think I found it. Jake?> I circled, flapped my wings to gain altitude. <Rachel? Tobias?
Anybody?>
An armored truck rumbled toward the plane. The driver stopped, showed one of the guards a
clipboard, then backed up to the cargo hold. The rear of the truck opened. Two guys in hooded yellow
coveralls climbed out. Pulled oxygen masks over their faces and unlatched the plane’s cargo door.
Okay. These guys definitely weren’t unloading souvenirs from Disneyland. If somebody was
transporting a chunk of Bug fighter wreckage, it had to be on this plane.
I caught a thermal and rose above the airport. A baggage cart trundled across the tarmac. A jet
screamed in for a landing. Guys in jumpsuits and headsets scrambled around, trying to keep the 747’s
from mowing down the commuter planes.
And everywhere I looked - seagulls. On the roof, on the tarmac, against the fence. Seagulls are
perfect cover. Part of the landscape, just like pigeons. Nobody even notices them. My own seagull
morph blended right in.
Unfortunately, Jake, Rachel, Marco, and Ax blended right in, too.
I spotted a lone gull flitting back and forth beside a hangar at the far end of the runway. Beyond
it, a red-tailed hawk sat perched on a chain-link fence.
<Tobias? Is that you?>
No answer. I didn’t really expect one. Thought-speak is sort of like a radio signal, and the hawk
was too far away to get decent reception.
I pulled my wings back and soared toward the hawk - then banked and wheeled around.
A long black car shot from the hangar and sped toward the guarded plan. It swung around the
Marines and screeched to a sideways stop in front of the armored truck, blocking it in. The car doors
opened, and four men in suits got out.
I circled, flying as low as I could without drawing attention to myself. Below me, the oxygen-
masked guys were loading a crate from the cargo hold onto the armored truck.
The suits strode across the tarmac. The leader, a tall guy with a bald spot, headed directly for the
crate, the other three suits close on his heels.
“Sir. Step away from the vehicle.” The Marines weren’t quite as casual now. They planted their
feet wide apart and reached for their pistols.
Bald Spot ignored them and poked his head inside the back of the armored truck. Either the guy
was too stupid to be afraid of weird alien diseases, or he already knew the wreckage wasn’t
dangerous. Which meant one thing.
He was a Controller.
“I repeat, step away from the vehicle.” The Marines unsnapped their holsters.
“Relax, boys.” Bald Spot left the truck and strolled toward the guards. Flashed a badge. “CIA.
We’ll take over from here.”
The Marines didn’t budge. “We’re not leaving our post, sir. We have orders.”
“Well, you have new orders now” - Bald Spot squinted at the two black stripes on the Marine’s
collar - “corporal.”",Ani 43.0 - The Unexpected - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

My name is Marco.
And I am to cuisine what Sammy Sosa is to baseball.
When it’s my night to make dinner, I don’t order in. I don’t crack open a can of Chef Boyardee
and call that a meal. Please.
I go the extra mile.
I use the oven.
I know. You’re saying to yourself, “But, Marco, man, you’re fighting a war against alien
invaders. You and your friends, you guys battle Yeerks twenty-four seven. How do you find the time
to cook?!”
It isn’t easy. But with a little help from the freezer aisle and a guy I know called Red Baron, it’s
a lot simpler than it could be.
Plus, this particular night, I was trying to make my stepmom feel, well, glad that she’d married
my dad. Even if I wasn’t one hundred percent behind the whole thing, she made my dad happy. That’s
worth something.
A car pulled into the driveway, a car door closed, heels clipped up the sidewalk. Nora, my
stepmother.
I threw three paper plates on the table, spread out some silverware, grabbed cups and a block of
napkins. Nora doesn’t go for paper plates, but hey, it wasn’t her night to do the dishes.
The door opened. I heard a sigh, the sound of a heavy bag dropped to the foyer floor.
“Hey,” I called.
“Hey,” Nora called back. “That faculty meeting lasted far longer than it …” The smell of Red
Baron’s home cooking met her nostrils, no doubt. “Marco!” she cried, entering the kitchen. “You’re
really making dinner!” She glanced at the paper plates and decided not to comment. “You’re the
stepson of my dreams.”
The woman was a math teacher. I would never really understand her. And now she was going
goopy on me.
I forced a smile. “Crazy, isn’t it?”
Another car pulled into the drive. Whistling, then rapid steps up the walk.
I grabbed a few sodas from the fridge.
The front door opened. Dad was all spring-in-his-step, a big smile plastered across his face. His
cheeks were flushed. He looked like he’d just struck oil.
“Hello, family!”
Okay, that was more enthusiasm than I wanted to see. And the word family, when applied to
anyone but me, Dad, and my real mom, would always sound very weird. To worsen the nausea, Dad
pulled a bouquet of flowers from behind his back.
They were not for me.
I think there was a kiss. Maybe some mushy whispers. I don’t know. I looked away. I see enough
of the “power of love” between Jake and Cassie, and Rachel and Tobias.
“What’s the occasion?” Nora giggled like a middle-schooler and sat at the table.
“Oh, nothing,” Dad said, beaming at her from the chair opposite. “You’re just the most
wonderful woman in the world.”
“I know better than that.” Her adult voice reemerged as she set the flowers aside. “What’s gotten",Ani 45.0 - The Revelation - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

“This is the resistance.”
I had never heard more pride in Prince Jake’s voice. I know I had never been more proud of him.
<Yes, and what is it you want? How is it you are communicating with us?>
Clearly, the Andalite officer on the other end of our interplanetary connection was not similarly
impressed.
Rachel snorted. Jake shot a look at her before speaking. “Look,” he said, “we don’t have much
time here. This transmission could be tracked. And we have a lot to talk about. First, the Anati world
situation, it’s a trap. The Yeerks have constructed huge Dracon cannon sites on all the moons. Your
fleet goes there, it’s obliterated.”
There was a moment of silence. An understandable delay, given the enormous distance over
which we were transmitting and the primitiveness of our transmitting device.
But I suspected the silence meant something else.
<We know of your situation on Earth, human.> The voice belonged to another Andalite. Its tone
suggested an officer superior to the one with whom Jake had just spoken.
“Yes,” Jake began, “but things have changed. We -”
<We know that you are in need of our assistance.>
“Rude,” Marco mumbled. “Let a guy finish a sentence.”
The voice went on, cold and imperious. An Andalite’s voice. <And we must consider the
possibility that you would lie to us in an effort to become our top priority.>
“What the … ?”
Cassie grabbed Rachel’s arm, motioned for her to be silent.
“Look,” Jake said, controlled anger making his voice tense. “We’ve got the information on good
authority. And you have no reason to suspect us of double-dealing.”
“Yes, he does.” Marco again. “We’re puny, backward humans. Not great, honorable Andalites.”
<Prince Jake, if I may?>
Jake nodded and I stepped forward, closer to the still unperfected device.
Since coming to this faraway planet, I have spoken to my people on several occasions.
Once, via adjustments I made to a primitive human radio telescope. Adjustments that allowed me
to break into Zero-space.
Once, on an Andalite ship commanded by the traitor, Samilin-Corrath-Gahar.
On two other occasions, I have conversed with Andalites who had also come to Earth.
But this - this was different. Everything was different. The war was escalating. The Andalites,
my people, had to listen to us. They had to be made to listen.
<This is Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill,> I said. <What my prince says is correct. Our source for the
information regarding the Anati planet comes from none other than Visser One, originator of the Yeerk
invasion on this planet. Visser One was sent to build the Anati defenses and to draw the Andalite
fleet. Recently the visser returned to Earth. We eliminated the Yeerk and liberated the host. This is the
truth.>
<That’ll show them,> Tobias said. Tobias - my shorm, a nothlit. Our lookout.
What came next I had not expected. Later, I wondered why, with my varied experience of
Andalite character, I had not entertained the possibility of my own people’s suspicion and neglect.

My name is Jake.
But you already know who I am.
Not “Commander Jake” or “Chief Jake” or even “Captain Jake.” Just Jake. That’s what everyone
calls me, even now.
Now that my entire life is devoted to strategy, and preparation and battle against the Yeerks.
It’s my job to keep us alive. It’s my job to think about the moral and practical consequences of
our actions.
I like to think I’m not one of those guys with a huge ego. But sometimes I feel like no one notices
what I’m doing. And it bothers me. Both that no one notices and that I care.
Okay, I get “Prince Jake,” but only from Ax.
Definitely not at home.
“Jake!” My mom. “Thank goodness you’re home. It’s about to storm and I’m late to pick up
Homer from the vet. Where have you been?”
Mom doesn’t have a clue about the Yeerks. I’d like to keep it that way.
“Out,” I said. Exhaustion can make you act like a jerk.
Truth is, it’s been months since I slept a full night. There’s no time for sound sleep anymore.
Rachel, Cassie, and I barely make it to school these days. Marco and Tobias don’t make it at all.
Because the Yeerks are on the move. Big time.
Ax monitors the Yeerks’ Z-space transmissions day and night. Most of the important stuff is too
carefully encrypted for even Ax to decode using cobbled-together, human-made components. But little
pieces of casual conversation point to one thing. Something major. Something huge.
As if we needed Z-space eavesdropping to tell us what was already abundantly clear.
The end is near.
We don’t know when or how it will come. But we know it’s coming.
When the Yeerks attacked a U.S. aircraft carrier not long ago, they took a huge and semi-public
step toward all-out, full-scale invasion.
We managed to hurt the effort enough to make the Yeerks retreat. But they definitely haven’t
given up.
“Listen carefully.” Mom grabbed her keys, put them in her purse. “It’s going to start raining any
minute. I want you to close all the windows in the house right away. Then I need you to clear out the
storage room in the basement.”
And I’d been hoping to catch five minutes on the couch. “Uh, Mom? Can’t I do that tomorrow?
Please?”
“Nope. The contractor’s coming first thing in the morning to give an estimate on the new rec-
room. Besides, it’ll earn you twenty bucks.”
Mom pulled on her rain jacket. “I piled some storage boxes at the top of the stairs. If you want a
cozy place for you and your friends to hang out, I suggest you get to work.”
Cozy place. I almost laughed out loud. There wasn’t going to be a cozy place anywhere if we
didn’t come up with a plan to stop the Yeerk invasion.
I opened the door to the basement. A tall stack of cardboard boxes blocked my way. Fine. I was
leader of a group of resistance fighters, Earth’s only hope for freedom, and I had to clean the
basement to earn a lousy twenty bucks. Talk about irony.",Ani 47.0 - The Resistance - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

The human child, one of those who called themselves Animorphs, asked me to explain. In that
final moment, the human wanted to know: Was it all worth it? The pain, the despair, the fear. The
horror of violence suffered, and the corrupting horror of violence inflicted, was it all worth it?
I said I could not answer that. I said that the battle was not yet done.

Marco threw me a look. One of those looks that said, “If they only knew.”
If they only knew there’s someone else right here on Earth possibly far more powerful than any
president or king or prime minister.
Jake and Marco think it’s better people don’t know the truth about that someone else.
Me?
Lately I wonder.
Lately I think it might be better to go public.
Let the world know that Earth has been invaded by an alien species led by someone - something
- more evil and more powerful than most humans can probably imagine.
That’s what I think.
I’m Rachel.
No last name. You probably already know why. But in case you don’t, it’s for security. Yours and
ours. And it’s the same with all of us.
We’re the Animorphs. Jake, Tobias, Cassie, Marco, and me.
We’re also just kids, at least on the outside. You wouldn’t know us if you saw us cruising the
mall on a Saturday afternoon or riding a bike down the middle of the street.
Or touring the White House with a bunch of other kids.
Fact: We aren’t like other kids.
We were once. But never again.
After a certain point, you just can’t go back to where you started. Even if you want to. Which I
have to admit - I don’t.
To repeat: The Yeerks are here. Parasitic aliens. Their goal is to conquer the human race. And
believe me they’ve been doing it, one human at a time.
But they’re getting impatient now. And more aggressive.
Maybe you’ve seen something about the Yeerks on the internet.
Maybe also about us. Recently, we were involved in a big throw down on an aircraft carrier out
in the middle of the ocean.
And there was an episode with some campers that went bad.
The actual events got some press coverage, but the stories were buried on the back pages.
Relegated to Web sites run by sci-fi fans.
The only people who believed the few witnesses with the nerve or dementia to tell the truth
about what they saw are pretty much the same folks who believe every nutty story they hear from the

page of the Enquirer. Baby born with antelope snout. Melted Snickers bar in shape of St. Francis’s

alligators in the subway.

My name is Tobias. And I was one hungry bird.
I was perched in a tree at the edge of my meadow. A meadow grown crisp and brown from too
many days without rain. The sun blazed overhead. Wind whispered through the weeds.
And among the rippling stalks, one, then two twisted slightly in another direction. I dug my
talons into the bark of the branch and waited.
Listened.
Mouse feet scrabbled against hard-packed dirt. Mouse teeth chewed through the shell of a seed.
Chewed. Stopped. Scrabbled.
Stopped.
I waited.
Nothing. No sound. No movement. The mouse remained still. Also listening? Waiting?
I tensed. Cocked my head.
And thought, not for the first time, about the irony of my hunt. In my old life, my life as a boy, I
was the mouse. The prey. Stalked by predators bent on flushing my head down the men’s room toilet.
Scurrying to find a hiding place. Rarely succeeding.
Another irony: In my old life, my life as prey, food was not a problem. I was on the free lunch
program at school. So I knew exactly where my next meal was coming from. Overheated ladies in
hair nets slapped it on a tray and handed it to me.
Movement. Small. A single blade of grass tipped toward a bare patch of dirt. Claws scritched
against earth.
The mouse was coming out into the open.
I opened my wings, pushed off the branch, and circled, high above the meadow, then began to
descend. My shadow grew larger and darker over the patch of dirt.
Weeds twitched, first one, then the next, as the mouse moved closer to open ground.
Dust billowed out from the undergrowth. Then a nose. Brown. Whiskered. I raked my talons
forward.
The mouse scuttled out, completely unprotected now. I dropped. In a split second the mouse
would be mine. In a split second my hunger would be -
No!
Scales. A flash of yellow. Fangs sinking into the mouse’s flesh.
That’s when I heard it. An ominous rattle.
Yeah. Like I needed a warning. I flapped hard and rose, talons empty. I was hungry but I wasn’t
stupid. I wouldn’t fight a six-foot rattlesnake over a poisoned mouse.
I climbed higher, glided above the meadow, and watched the snake devour my lunch. A
diamondback that had lain coiled, waiting, motionless, in the very spot I’d been watching. In the
meadow. My meadow.
I circled and swooped back to my branch.
Would a normal hawk have seen it? Maybe. Probably.
Your normal red-tailed hawk, equipped with the standard-issue hawk brain, has a basic train of
thought. Hunger. Food. Kill. Eat. Brilliant in its simplicity. The hawk is not distracted by ironic
musings. The hawk doesn’t reminisce about toilets and school cafeterias.

Tsseeeewww! Tsseeeewww!
I dropped to the ground. Dracon fire narrowly missed frying my head. Before the enemy could
squeeze off another round, I rolled into one of the newly dug trenches.
The trench was muddy, the soil teeming with earthworms. Gross, but it was protection. And the
trench was deep enough for me to morph big. But under an attack like this, I knew to go small.
Tsseeeewww! Tsseeeewww!
More Dracon fire whizzed by overhead. And then I heard the sound that always makes my blood
run cold.
Like somebody sharpening knives. Stalking me. Preparing to kill.
It’s a sound I seriously don’t enjoy.
The sound of Hork-Bajir.
Hork-Bajir are massive creatures. Seven feet tall with machete-like blades on their elbows,
their knees, and their foreheads. They’re not natural diggers, like the Taxxons. But they can move a
powerful amount of earth if they have to.
“Hrrath!”
Tsseeeewww!
A shout and another round of Dracon fire. The whisking, knife-sharpening sound receded
slightly. I poked my head above the rim of the trench. Saw Marco running across the compound yard,
another group of Hork-Bajir close behind him.
He was creating a diversion. Helping me to escape. Giving me time to morph.
Marco dove into another trench.
I knew what to do. We’d planned it in advance. Rehearsed it endlessly.
We’d use our roach morphs to escape the compound through a network of underground pipes
we’d laid beneath the trenches.
I closed my eyes to begin the morph. From ground level, more shouts and explosions. Were my
parents out there vulnerable to the attack? Terrified?
The morph was slow to start. I couldn’t concentrate. Fix the image of the roach in your mind,
Cassie. Fix it and morph.
No use. I couldn’t keep the roach within view. Instead, I saw my mother.
Saw the look on her face when, for the very first time, she watched me morph.
What would her face look like now if she saw me burrowing in a muddy trench full of worms,
dung, and rotted vegetation?
Stop it! I ordered myself. You have to do this! So, do it.
I concentrated hard. Nothing. I couldn’t morph. And I’m the one who’s supposed to be so good at
it.
<Cassie! Come on! Where are you?> Marco.
I concentrated harder. Now it was my dad’s face that appeared in my mind. He looked sad and
disappointed. As if until this moment he’d never realized that evil really did exist. Not only in the big
“out there.” But right in his own backyard.
The Hork-Bajir were closing in. I could hear their blades slicing the air. It was new or never.
If only I could know my parents had taken cover, reached safety!

I dove. Tucked my wings. Folded my tail. Hurtled toward earth!
I was a bullet. A bullet with feathers.
And feeling pretty righteous until Tobias rocketed past. He skimmed the top of the freight train
and looped sideways in a corkscrew roll, wing over wing. His feathers grazed the big gun of one of
the tanks.
<Show-off,> I said.
<Hey, I’m a hawk.> He pulled out of the roll. <I only get so many hobbies, and perfecting my
Red-Tail Spiral of Death happens to be my favorite.>
We pumped our wings and shot past the locomotive. Two guys wearing bib overalls and ball
caps sat inside. One, the engineer, I guessed, was driving while the other watched the track ahead.
They weren’t wielding Dracon beams. Or weapons of any kind. And they weren’t paying any
attention to the osprey and red-tailed hawk who’d dropped from the sky to spy on them.
<They don’t look like Controllers,> said Tobias. <Like that means anything.>
<Yeah. Everything looks normal,> I said. <Well, except for the tanks.>
I wheeled. Scanned the line of flatcars. Nothing unusual. Nothing that wasn’t supposed to be
there.
Still, something prickled at the back of my brain. Something didn’t seem right.
Battling aliens every day of my life has fine-tuned my already rampant paranoia.
I powered my wings and caught up to Tobias and the locomotive. A beautiful thermal radiated up
the side of the mountain. I fanned my wing and tail feathers and soared on the billowing jet of warm
air.
The freight train clattered below. One engine pulling a line of flatbed cars, loaded with military
tanks. M-1 Abrams.
Yeah, M-1 Abrams. I knew them as well as I knew my own PlayStation. All those hours playing
Tank Commando had finally paid off.
The M-1s belonged to the National Guard. They were chained one to a flatcar, their big guns
rotated toward the back. And they were headed toward the city.
Truck and Humvee convoys had been snaking into town for days. Battalions of National Guard
soldiers from all over the state were bunkered in Guard centers around the city.
Now they were bringing in tanks.
Ax had been monitoring all the local TV channels and the cable news networks, but nobody had
mentioned a wide-scale urban training exercise. I couldn’t find anything on the Internet, and the Chee
hadn’t heard anything from their Yeerk sources, either.
Tobias and I were here to do a little firsthand investigation. To find out if our state government
had finally realized Earth was being invaded. To see if they were mounting a defense.
Or to see if this was a carefully laid out Yeerk plan. Were all those National Guard troops
Controllers? Some of them, yeah. But all of them? We were talking thousands of soldiers. If they were
all Controllers, we were in big trouble. We were talking serious doo-doo.

swooped and circled.
James, in peregrine falcon morph, followed, circling almost in tandem with Rachel.
That kind of close formation flying was a mistake.
Different species of birds of prey do not typically fly together, especially in synchronized
motion.
I was in northern harrier morph, several feet above my companions and hanging back. Trying to
keep a reasonable distance between us in case we were being observed from the ground.
I wondered if Rachel would rebuke James. He was new and sometimes made minor mistakes.
But Rachel was too eager to pursue her investigation into what was taking place on the ground
below to correct James.
I, too, said nothing to James. Of all the Animorphs, I had been most opposed to our recruiting
handicapped young humans to be warriors alongside us in our fight against the Yeerks. So far, the
overall performance of James and the others had set my mind somewhat at ease.
Still, I was uncomfortable treating James and his team as a true part of the resistance.
And even after all this time on my adopted planet, Earth, I was acutely aware of being an
outsider. The only Andalite, the only alien in our band of guerrillas. Though on several occasions I
had spoken my mind, on many others I had hesitated to do so.
I had no real authority over James or Rachel. They were likely to reject any instructions or
directives from me.
Rachel, because she listened to no one but Jake, and then, often with barely concealed
resentment. And James, because he acted as leader and to some degree protector, of the seventeen
new recruits. James was Jake’s lieutenant.
Jake is our leader. He had sent the three of us on a reconnaissance mission. We were to make
note of what was happening in the city and report back to our base of operations. The secret Hork-
Bajir camp.
I doubt that Jake had anticipated anything as dramatic as what I saw below me. It appeared that
the city was under military occupation.
Police, uniformed military men and women, and official trucks and cars blocked off many
streets.
Drivers were being stopped and asked to exit their cars. Then they were taken to join the crowds
of people being diverted into train stations at gunpoint.
<What’s going on?> James asked. <Are those people being protected, or persecuted? Evacuated
for their own protection? Or being taken prisoner?>
<I can’t tell,> Rachel answered. <That’s the problem when the good guys and the bad guys all
look alike. It’s hard to know who’s an uninfested human and who’s a Controller. This war gets more
complicated every day.>
I agreed with Rachel’s statement.
My name is Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill. It is my real name. The others do not use their real
names, though at this point, they could do so without increasing the danger of discovery.
Our identities are known now to our enemies. We have been exposed. The danger could not get
any nearer, clearer, or greater.",Ani 52.0 - The Sacrifice - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

<They’re going after the elementary school,> Tobias said.
<They’re going after everything,> I answered.
<Why are they doing this? It makes no sense,> Tobias said. <It’s not just brutal; it’s stupid.
Pointless destruction.>
The nearest Bug fighter swooped low and slow. It fired its Dracon beams and the two-story gym
exploded into charred stucco and twisted steel beams.
It drifted almost casually above the tired old low-slung classrooms and fired again, dragging the
beam end-to-end along the buildings.
<They’re sending a message,> I said. <Mess with us and this is what we do.>
We had destroyed the Yeerk pool. The Yeerk pool was now the world’s biggest sinkhole. It
looked like a crater. It was a crater, with half the mall in ruins on one slope, jumbled bits of fast-food
restaurants, streetlights, ripped up concrete, cars, skinny trees, all tumbled together at the bottom. The
water of the Yeerk pool, looking like molten lead, soaked up through the dirt. An Exxon sign lay half-
submerged in it. A couple of dozen empty one-liter soda bottles drifted around like someone’s idea of
toy boats.
How many Yeerks had died? Certainly thousands. Maybe tens of thousands. How many Hork-
Bajir? How many Taxxons?
Humans?
We had tried to warn people, but the devastation had been too complete, had come too suddenly.
<It’s not a message, Big Jake,> Marco said. <The Yeerks know now that we’ll do whatever we
have to do, they know it’s all-out war. We blew up their only on-planet food supply. We’re way past
sending messages. Look: They’re drawing a circle.>
Marco was a hundred feet higher up than me. He was in osprey morph, I was in falcon, Tobias
was himself: a red-tailed hawk.
<Marco’s right,> Tobias said. <They’re making a big circle.>
More Bug fighters than I’d ever seen in one place. Maybe fifty of the things. They blasted
schools; they blasted businesses; they blasted homes and churches. The shock waves would reach us,
echoes of destruction. Pillars of smoke rose high in the air. Fires, some blazing and roaring, others
smoldering sullenly, created thermal updrafts that were bread and butter to three mismatched birds of
prey. We soared easily, effortlessly. We had the best possible seats for the show. With raptor eyes we
could see every sickening detail. We could not miss a shot, could not fail to see lovingly tended
gardens, prized homes, businesses, cars, burn as quickly and brightly as match heads.
The refugees people who had been our neighbors, friends, classmates the shocked, scared, lost
refugees fled on foot, carrying what they could, running between stalled cars. Overpasses were all
down, traffic lights all off, bridges were collapsed: Nothing with four wheels was moving.
A news helicopter was perhaps five miles off, no doubt filming and sending the pictures out live.
The Yeerks could easily shoot down the copter. They were letting it film. Maybe even piloting the
craft themselves. They wanted the world to see the violence. They wanted humans to be afraid. The
infiltration phase of the war was over, over. From now on the Yeerks would be as subtle as
sledgehammers.
I caught a rush of warm air, the thermal energy released by a burning supermarket, and I soared
higher, up and up. I could see what Marco and Tobias had understood: The Yeerks were creating a",Ani 53.0 - The Answer - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,

My name is Rachel.
I knew what was coming. I knew.
I’d seen it in Jake’s eyes.
And you know what? I was scared.
I never thought I would be. Cassie thinks I’m fearless. Marco thinks I’m reckless. Tobias …
well, Tobias loves me.
I guess they all do, in different ways. Jake, too. But Jake had to do the right thing.
I felt sorry for him, you know? He’s carried the weight so long. He’s made hard decisions. None
as hard as this maybe. I didn’t blame him, not even for a minute.
But I was scared.
I guess no one wants to die. I guess everyone is scared when the time comes.
We were so close. We were right there, right at the finish line, I’d already survived so many
times when I shouldn’t have. It seemed unfair. To come this far, get this close …
Jake gave me the job because he knew that only I could do it. Would do it. Ax might have, sure,
but he was needed for his skills. Me, I’m not the computer genius. I’m the one you send when you
need someone to be crazy, to do the hard thing.
I don’t know whether I’m proud of that or not.
I was Jake’s insurance policy. He thought maybe he wouldn’t have to use me. He hoped, anyway.
But down deep he knew, and I knew, and we both hid the truth from the others because Cassie
couldn’t let Jake make that decision, and Tobias couldn’t let me, and those two, by loving us, would
have screwed everything up.
It was a war, after all. A war we had to win.
We hadn’t asked the Yeerks to come to Earth. They made that call on their own. They’re a
parasitic species, not very big or impressive to look at, just these snail-like things that can enter your
head through your ear. They have a capacity to anesthetize the inner ear enough to allow them to
burrow through the soft tissue. It still hurts but not as much as it should.
They dig their way straight to your brain and then flatten themselves out, spread themselves
down into the crevices, tie directly into your synapses. They take control. Absolute control.
They read your thoughts, they sense your emotions. What your eyes see, they see. What your
tongue tastes, they taste. If your hand moves, it’s because they moved it. If you speak, it is the Yeerk
who has spoken through you, made you into a ventriloquist’s dummy.
Over the course of years they spread like a virus. Invisible. Undetectable.
They are your teacher, your pastor, your best friend. They are the police officer, the TV
newsman, the soldier. Anyone.
Jake’s parents had recently been taken; they were human-Controllers - people controlled by
Yeerks.
Jake’s brother Tom, my cousin, had been a Controller for a long time. He was a powerful Yeerk.
Jake still cared for him, still hoped somehow he could be saved.
Jake had sent me away with Tom.
I understood. I approved. If Jake hadn’t sent me I’d have gone anyway.
Still, though, I was scared.
I had power myself. We all did. The strange, unsettling power to absorb DNA from any living",Ani 54.0 - The Beginning - K. A. Applegate_cover.png,
