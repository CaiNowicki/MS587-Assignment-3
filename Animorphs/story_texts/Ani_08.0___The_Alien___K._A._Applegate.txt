Prologue
Before Earth …
<Prepare for return to normal space,> Captain Nerefir said in thought-speak.
I was on the bridge of our Dome ship. It was an amazing moment. I had never been on the bridge
before. I’d always been stuck in my quarters, or up in the dome. It was an honor to be on the battle
bridge with the full warriors, the princes, and the captain himself.
It was because I was Elfangor’s little brother. An aristh like me, a warrior-cadet, wouldn’t have
been on the bridge otherwise.
Especially not an aristh who had once run into Captain Nerefir so hard he’d fallen over and
ended up bruising one of his eye stalks. It was an accident, but still, it’s just not a good idea for lowly
cadets to go plowing into great heroes.
But everyone loved Elfangor, so they had to tolerate me. That’s the story of my life. If I live two
hundred years, I’ll probably still be known as Elfangor’s little brother.
We came out of Z-space or Zero-space, a realm of white emptiness, back into normal space.
Through the monitors I saw nothing but blackness dotted with stars. And there, just ahead of us, no
more than a half-million miles away, was a small, mostly blue planet.
<Is that Earth?> I asked Elfangor. <I didn’t realize there was so much water. Can you get Old
Hoof and Tail to let me go down to the planet with you?>
<Aximili, shut up!> Elfangor said quickly. He looked slightly sick and cast a dubious glance at
Captain Nerefir.
I guess I had been thought-speaking a little loudly. Elfangor was worried that War-Prince Nerefir
might have overheard. But I was sure I hadn’t been that loud. I mean, I really didn’t think that -
<Old Hoof and Tail, eh?> Captain Nerefir said. <Is that what they call me?>
Elfangor shot me a poisonous look. <I’m sure this aristh didn’t mean any disrespect.>
I think my brother would have liked to throw me out of the nearest airlock right at that moment.
Slowly Nerefir turned his two main eyes toward me. He was a frightening old Andalite. A great
warrior. A great hero. Elfangor’s idol. <Ah, it’s the ruffian. The wild brat who knocked me over.> He
nodded. <Old Hoof and Tail, is it? Well. I kind of like the name.> He slowly winked one eye at
Elfangor. <I suppose we’ll have to let the ruffian live.>
Suddenly …
<Yeerks! We have a Yeerk mother ship in orbit over the planet!> the warrior at the sensor station
cried.
<They’re launching fighters! I count twelve Yeerk Bug fighters,> another warrior cried.
<They’re on an intercept course. They’ll be in firing range in twelve Earth minutes.>
Captain Nerefir turned his face and his main eyes toward my brother, while his stalk eyes kept
watch on the monitors. The humor was gone from his face. <Prince Elfangor? It is time. Launch all
fighters.>
But Elfangor hadn’t waited for orders. He was already halfway out the door. My tail banged into
the doorway as I plowed after him.
<Get to the dome, Aximili,> Elfangor said.
<But I want to fight!> I said. <I can fly a fighter as well as ->
<Do not argue with me, Aximili. Arisths do not go into battle. You are not a full warrior yet. Go
