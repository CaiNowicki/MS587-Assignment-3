Introduction
Okay, listen up. It’s Jake. You probably already know what’s going on around here. But just in
case you don’t, here’s the deal: Rachel, Tobias, Cassie, Marco, Ax, and I are five kids and one alien
out to save the world.
No, this isn’t a joke. It’s real. About as real as you can get. Real enough for screaming
nightmares about the things you’ve seen and done.
Because sometimes the stuff you see in the movies, the stuff you thought could never, ever
happen to you … well, it can happen. It does happen. I’ve seen it.
I can’t tell you my last name. Or where I live. There’s an alien invasion going on. Right here on
Earth. But I’m not talking little green guys with ray guns. I’m talking a much smarter way to conquer a
world. Just invade people’s brains.
I’m not nuts. I’ve seen it. And because of that, my friends and I were given a special power - the
power to morph into any animal we touch. To acquire its DNA. It’s the only way we can fight the
Yeerks - that’s what they call themselves. We have to find a way to stop these slugs that get into
people’s heads and make them slaves.
But things have gotten worse. We need backup. A new Animorph. We’ve tried this once before
and it didn’t work out. At all. We’re going to try again. So, if you’re interested in joining us, let’s go.
Just remember not to read this missions like a normal book. Check out the instructions and follow
them.
You get to choose your morphs, but I’m warning you now - choose them very carefully. You have
to deal with the consequences. They can either help you, or get you totally annihilated.
This isn’t a game. It’s serious stuff. So if you can handle it, turn to the next page.
Oh. One more thing? Good luck.
You’ll need it.
