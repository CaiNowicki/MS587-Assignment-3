Chapter 1
My name is Jake.
And I was one sorry cockroach.
<Aaaaaahhhhh!> I yelled as I twirled and fell and spun downward toward the ground far below.
Not that I could see the ground. Cockroach eyes are strictly for close-up work. And they’re not
even good at that.
So I couldn’t see the ground thousands of feet below. Nor could I see Marco, Cassie, Ax, and
David, also cockroaches and also falling through the air.
I could hear them, though.
<Aaaaaahhhhh!> Marco yelled.
<Aaaaaahhhhh!> Cassie agreed.
Only Ax was silent. He’s an Andalite. They don’t scream quite as much as humans. It’s not that
they’re braver, it’s more that they’re a telepathic species. So I guess they just didn’t evolve to do a lot
of screaming.
<We’re gonna dieeee!> David yelled in thought-speak panic.
<I do not believe the impact will kill us,> Ax said. <I don’t believe our mass is sufficient to
cause death when we impact.>
<He’s right!> Cassie cried. <You can’t kill a cockroach by dropping it. Not even from this
high.>
<Unless that’s water below us,> Marco said. <In which case we could hit the water and get
chomped by some big hungry fish.>
<Should we demorph?> Ax wondered.
<No time,> I said. <We’d get bigger, more mass, and then when we hit we’d ->
I stopped falling. In an instant something hit me. But it hit me going sideways. A gigantic talon
closed around me.
<That is you guys, right?> Rachel’s thought-speak voice asked calmly. <I mean I figure,
cockroaches falling through the air, gotta be you guys.>
<Yeah, you seldom see cockroaches at a thousand feet up,> Tobias agreed. Rachel and Tobias
had not been aboard the spacecraft. The spacecraft that had kidnapped the president’s helicopter. The
one we’d fallen out of. In cockroach morph.
Maybe I should back up and explain.
It all began when we discovered that the blue box - the morphing cube - had been found by a kid
named David.
Well, no, actually it all began much earlier. Months ago, when Marco, Cassie, Rachel, Tobias,
and I happened to be walking home from the mall by way of an abandoned construction site.
Which is where we saw the damaged spacecraft landing. And where we met Elfangor, an
Andalite prince. Elfangor was dying. His enemies, the Yeerks, were hot on his trail. He was out of
time.
So he did something Andalites don’t usually do: He trusted some non-Andalites. Namely, the
five of us. He told us that Earth was being invaded by a race of parasites called Yeerks.
The Yeerks are slugs, really. Not very impressive-looking or scary. But they have the ability to
enter a brain - almost any brain - and take control of it. Absolute, complete, total control.
They’ve done this to the entire race of Gedds from their own home world. They’ve done it to the
