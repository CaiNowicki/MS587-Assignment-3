Chapter 1
It was happening again. Unbelievably, it was happening again.
A woman was drowning. Not the dreaded leader of an alien force. Just a woman. Alone in a
roiling sea. Defenseless. Vulnerable.
My mother.
There was no way I could let it happen again.
I powered toward her. My arms strained with each stroke. My legs kicked wildly.
Hold on. Hold on!
So close. Close enough to see her straining to keep her head above the cold black water.
Then I was on her, one arm around her shoulders, the other paddling madly to keep us afloat.
“Hold on!” I cried. “I’ve got you!”
She looked up at me, wet hair plastering her face. Then she spoke. “Thank you, Marco.”
“Mom …”
“I’m free, Marco. I’m free!”
And then a powerful current swept her out of my grasp and sucked her under the glittering
surface of the midnight ocean.
“No! No, no, no!”
I dove. The salt stung my eyes. I pushed deeper and deeper into the darkness. My lungs ached but
I would not allow it to happen again. I would not let her go! Not when she was free. Not …
“NO!”
“Marco? Are you okay?”
I shot up straight as a board. Where … ? My bed, my room. My father.
I put my hands to my head and looked at the picture of my mother that sat on my nightstand.
“You okay?” he repeated.
No. I wasn’t. “Yeah. Yeah. Bad dream, I guess.”
“About her?”
I swallowed hard. “Yeah.”
Dad sat on the edge of my bed and hugged me.
I returned the hug weakly. Patted him on the back.
“I’m okay, big guy,” I said. “What time is it?”
“About time to get up and get going,” he said. “I get the shower first. I have to be in early today.”
I watched my father leave the room. But instead of getting out of bed and heading downstairs for
a bowl of Honeycomb, I sat amidst the tangled, slightly damp bedcovers, too exhausted to move.
My name, as you probably know by now, is Marco. And that was how my Friday started. Not the
greatest way to greet the last day of a long week. But not exactly uncommon. Dreams of fear and loss
and despair.
Before I lost my mother to the enemy, before I learned of the Yeerk invasion of Earth, my life
was pretty tame. Mostly I worried about things like whether I’d dropped enough hints at dinner about
which Sega disk I wanted for my birthday.
Not about things like the enslavement of the human race.
Those were the days. Or, as Dad says, “The salad days.”
I’m not sure what that means exactly - “salad days” - but he says it a lot. I’m not a big fan of
salad myself, unless it’s heavily croutoned.
